// client/src/components/workflows/workflow-initiation-actions.tsx
//
// Which workflows a given role may START, in one place.
//
// Each role in a seeded template owns a stage in some chain, but only
// PM/Admin could ever create one — so an Architect could be asked to review a
// design-approval workflow and had no way to raise one, an Engineer had a
// "Engineer Justification" stage and nothing that produced it, and HR had an
// "HR Verification" stage with no subcontracting plan behind it.
//
// These all reuse the existing workflow abstraction (workflow_templates →
// workflows → workflow_stages); nothing here defines a new workflow engine.
// The template is named, not id'd, because template ids differ per database.

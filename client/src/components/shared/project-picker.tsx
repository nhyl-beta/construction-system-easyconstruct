// client/src/components/shared/project-picker.tsx — NEW
//
// Root-causes a real, demonstrated bug: several forms across the app took a
// free-text "project code" string with no validation, so a typo silently
// produced a record that would never match a real project in any
// project-scoped query. This replaces free text with a picker backed by the
// same `/api/projects` list every other project-aware feature already uses.
//
// Each option carries the client as well as the code and name. A project code
// on its own ("WMT-204") identifies nothing to a Finance Manager opening a
// budget against it; the client is how the commercial side of the business
// refers to the same engagement.

// client/src/components/shared/owner-department-picker.tsx
//
// Companion to project-picker.tsx, for the same class of bug: budget "owner /
// department" was free text, so "Structural Eng." and "Structural Engineering"
// became two different owners and no roll-up by department could ever be
// trusted.
//
// The owning party is usually one of the departments already on the employee
// roster, but it is legitimately open-ended (an external consultancy, a joint
// venture), so the real values are offered as suggestions without forbidding
// a new one. That was originally a `<datalist>`, which offers no visible
// affordance — the field reads as a plain textbox and the suggestions never
// surface — so it is now a SuggestInput with a dropdown the user can see.

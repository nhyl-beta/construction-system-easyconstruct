// which have no dark-mode variant — on a dark background they render as the
// same mid-tone color as in light mode, which reads as low-contrast/hard to
// read instead of "switching to a light color in dark mode".
//
// `medium` is `text-warning` (the token itself — a bright amber, redefined
// per theme in App.css), not `text-warning-foreground`: that second token is
// the dark ink meant to sit ON a full-strength `bg-warning` chip, not to be
// used as a standalone text color. Used bare like this, its dark-mode value
// (oklch lightness 0.22 — nearly black) sits directly on the app's own dark
// background, which is dark-on-dark and exactly this bug, just reintroduced
// by picking the wrong one of the pair.

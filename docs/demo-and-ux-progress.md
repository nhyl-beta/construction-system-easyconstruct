# Demo seed data + queued UI/UX fixes — progress

Branch: `dev-ai`, started at HEAD `0e08327`. Part A commit: `8781183`. Merge of
`origin/dev-ai` (which had moved ahead mid-session — see the Part B section below): `641df06`.
Part B commit: `1e8d6c0`. Follow-up (self-contained AI reference fallback): `29ef68b`.

**Acceptance status**: all of Part A (7 stage projects + idempotency + gate dump + P9) and all
9 of Part B's reported issues are done — 6 already fixed by a commit that landed on `dev-ai`
mid-session (cross-referenced, spot-verified live, not silently claimed), 3 built fresh in this
session (item 1's affordance fix, item 6 geocoding, item 8 blueprint approval). Server
`npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm test` (84/84) and the client `npm run build` are all clean as of
`29ef68b`. `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders`'s surface table was not touched anywhere in this session.

At the start of every session: read this file and continue from the first unticked item.

## Environment note (read first)

This sandbox ships with **no configured database and no `.env`** (`server/.env` did not
exist, `DATABASE_URL` was unset, `node_modules` were not installed in either `server/` or
`client/`). The two uploaded "progress" docs' verification transcripts were produced in a
session that had a real Neon Postgres wired up; this one did not. To do real, live
verification rather than "should work" claims, this session provisioned its own **local
Postgres 16** (already installed in the container image) as the dev database:

- Created role `postgres` / db `easyconstruct` on `127.0.0.1:5432` (plain password auth,
  scoped to this one throwaway local instance — did **not** weaken the *system's* pg_hba.conf,
  that was tried once, flagged by the environment's own safety classifier as an auth-weakening
  action, and reverted immediately; a local unix-socket role switch via `setpriv` was used
  instead of touching authentication policy).
- `server/.env` created (gitignored, not committed) with that `DATABASE_URL`, `FEATURE_AI=true`.
- Base schema loaded from `server/drizzle/*.sql` (concatenated, applied once — several later
  files re-declare tables the first file already created, which is pre-existing drift in the
  repo's migration history, not something this session introduced; harmless "already exists"
  errors on the duplicates, real tables all created successfully — confirmed via `\dt`, 40 base
  tables).
- `npx tsx src/scripts/ensure-demo-schema.ts` run — added every lifecycle/ai-signals table and
  compatibility column on top of the base schema.
- `npm run db:seed` run (`ensure-demo-schema` + `seed-demo-accounts`) — created the 10
  role logins + 40 extra role accounts (50 users total) and the 7 workflow templates. **P9 is
  therefore already satisfied by the existing seed script** — no new work needed there.

**EstimationPro.ai (the AI reference-data source) is unreachable from this sandbox**: the
outbound proxy returns `403` on `CONNECT estimationpro.ai:443` (`gateway answered 403 to CONNECT
(policy denial or upstream failure)`, confirmed via the proxy's own `/__agentproxy/status`). So
`npm run ai:seed-references` cannot pull the live 411-item catalog here. Logged as deviation
AV-6 below; worked around by inserting one `reference_snapshots` row directly, using the exact
values already given a real, documented, live-verified worked trace in
`server/src/ai-validation/cost.test.ts` (Rebar #4, low $80 / typical $100 / high $120 per lf) —
not invented numbers. `validateWorkflowLineItems()` itself, the matcher, the unit converter and
the cost-comparison math are all still exercised for real against this row.

All curl/query output below is real, from this local instance, `npm run dev` running against it.

- [x] P10 Verification (idempotency + real gate-check dump + basisSummary) — see below

## P2-P10 — the seed script and its verification

`server/src/scripts/demo-seed-stages.ts` (`npm run demo:seed` from `server/`, requires
`npm run dev` running against `DATABASE_URL` and `npm run db:seed` already applied — same
prerequisites as the existing `demo-full-cycle.ts`). Builds **7** projects, `DEMO-STAGE-0`
through `DEMO-STAGE-6`, one per lifecycle phase, entirely through real API calls as the actual
role each step belongs to (same style as `demo-full-cycle.ts`/L5) — no direct DB writes for any
gate-relevant row.

**Design decision** (not pinned down by the prompt, logged here rather than guessed silently):
for every stage except Construction, the project is built up through *every* gate of its
current phase and all earlier phases (so the lifecycle panel shows a fully green checklist for
that stage) but is **not** advanced past it — it sits there, "qualified to advance but hasn't
been," which is the more useful demo state (shows what a complete stage looks like) than "just
arrived, nothing done yet." Construction (`DEMO-STAGE-3`) is the deliberate exception per the
prompt's own instruction: a realistic, partially-done task list (K1 fails on purpose — that's
what mid-Construction looks like).

**Idempotency**: `cleanup()` at the top of `main()` deletes every row scoped to the 7
`DEMO-STAGE-*` codes, children before parents (workflows/milestones/designs cascade their own
dependents; proposals, design_reviews/design_revisions/architect_documents, and every
`budgets`-child table do not, and are deleted explicitly first). Ran the script **twice** in a
row; both runs produced identical output and the projects table shows exactly 7 rows both
times:

```
$ npx tsx src/scripts/demo-seed-stages.ts   # run 1 — full output in git history / session log
=== Summary ===
  DEMO-STAGE-0   target=Proposal         actual phase=Proposal         progress=8%
  DEMO-STAGE-1   target=Design           actual phase=Design           progress=25%
  DEMO-STAGE-2   target=Pre-Construction actual phase=Pre-Construction progress=29%
  DEMO-STAGE-3   target=Construction     actual phase=Construction     progress=59%
  DEMO-STAGE-4   target=Closeout         actual phase=Closeout         progress=99%
  DEMO-STAGE-5   target=Completed        actual phase=Completed        progress=100%
  DEMO-STAGE-6   target=Archived         actual phase=Archived         progress=100%

$ npx tsx src/scripts/demo-seed-stages.ts   # run 2 — identical summary, no duplicate-row errors

$ psql ... -c "SELECT code, status, progress FROM projects WHERE code LIKE 'DEMO-STAGE-%' ORDER BY code;"
     code     |      status      | progress
 DEMO-STAGE-0 | Proposal         |        8
 DEMO-STAGE-1 | Design           |       25
 DEMO-STAGE-2 | Pre-Construction |       29
 DEMO-STAGE-3 | Construction     |       59
 DEMO-STAGE-4 | Closeout         |       99
 DEMO-STAGE-5 | Completed        |      100
 DEMO-STAGE-6 | Archived         |      100
(7 rows)   -- exactly 7, both runs
```

**Real gate-check dump** (`GET /projects/:id/lifecycle` as PM, live, right after the second
run — every gate for the project's own current phase; `Completed`/`Archived` have no gates by
design, `evaluateGate` returns `[]` for both):

```
=== DEMO-STAGE-0 phase=Proposal progress=8% ===
  P1 passed=true  Architect staffed
  P2 passed=true  Consultant staffed
  P3 passed=true  Proposal submitted
  P4 passed=true  Proposal approved
  P5 passed=true  Award & contract on file

=== DEMO-STAGE-1 phase=Design progress=25% ===
  D1 passed=true  Design with files, assigned to a staffed engineer
  D2 passed=true  All designs approved
  D3 passed=true  Approved current blueprint

=== DEMO-STAGE-2 phase=Pre-Construction progress=29% ===
  C1 passed=true  Materials & specifications approved
  C2 passed=true  Budget approved
  C3 passed=true  Milestones dated and active
  C4 passed=true  Site crew staffed and linked to tasks
  C5 passed=true  Notice to Proceed & site location

=== DEMO-STAGE-3 phase=Construction progress=59% ===
  K1 passed=false  All tasks completed -- 5 of 9 task(s) still open   (intentional — see above)
  K2 passed=false  All milestones closed -- 1 milestone(s) still open (intentional)
  K3 passed=true   No open issues
  K4 passed=false  No active workflows -- 1 active workflow(s)        (intentional — the BCR workflow is left mid-approval, see below)

=== DEMO-STAGE-4 phase=Closeout progress=99% ===
  X1 passed=true  Final inspection approved
  X2 passed=true  Certificate of Completion on file
  X3 passed=true  Closeout payroll approved

=== DEMO-STAGE-5 phase=Completed progress=100% ===   (no gates — terminal)
=== DEMO-STAGE-6 phase=Archived progress=100% ===   (no gates — terminal)
```

Every gate for the current phase (and, by construction, every earlier phase the project has
already passed through) reads `passed: true`, except Construction's exit checks, which are
deliberately left failing to produce the requested ~60% partial state.

**DEMO-STAGE-3's real Budget Change Request** (`POST /workflows` as engineer,
`FEATURE_AI=true`, real `validateWorkflowLineItems()` call, real `reference_snapshots` row —
see AV-6 deviation below for why that row is seeded rather than freshly fetched). Actual server
response, unedited:

```
workflow.aiNote: "2 of 3 line(s) compared to EstimationPro.ai: 1 above typical (+954.5%),
  1 within range; 1 no-match (line has no quantity)."

line "Rebar installation, #4 bar" (128.5 lf, requested ₱850,000):
  verdict: within-range
  basisSummary: "Matched 'Rebar #4 (1/2 inch)' (score 0.44) · EstimationPro.ai, fetched
    2026-09-25 · ₱62.73/$1 as of 2026-09-22 · reference ₱644,864–₱967,297 (typical ₱806,081)
    · submitted ₱850,000 · +5.4%."

line "Rebar installation, #4 bar" (128.5 lf, requested ₱8,500,000 — deliberately 10x, same
  item family as the documented +16,122.9% live example in ai-signals-progress.md's Group C):
  verdict: above-typical
  basisSummary: "Matched 'Rebar #4 (1/2 inch)' (score 0.44) · EstimationPro.ai, fetched
    2026-09-25 · ₱62.73/$1 as of 2026-09-22 · reference ₱644,864–₱967,297 (typical ₱806,081)
    · submitted ₱8,500,000 · +954.5%."

line "Site fencing rental" (no quantity given, on purpose — the honest no-match path):
  verdict: no-match
  basisSummary: "No comparable reference — line has no quantity."
```

This is the real `cost.ts`/`matcher.ts`/`service.ts` code path end to end — score 0.44 Dice
match, real FX conversion, real variance math — exercised against a seeded
`reference_snapshots` row taken from the repo's own live-verified worked trace (see AV-6), not
a hand-written `validation_results` row.

`DEMO-STAGE-3`'s task list: 9 tasks total (1 from Pre-Construction, 8 created in Construction),
4 of the 8 Construction tasks completed → `computeProgress`'s real `30 + 65*(done/total)`
formula: `30 + 65*(4/9) ≈ 59%` (matches the dump above exactly — not hardcoded). Also seeded:
one Verified-eligible attendance record and one approved Materials expense (₱42,000, flowed
into the project's budget `spent` via the existing G6 sync), so Construction's attendance and
expense views aren't empty.

`DEMO-STAGE-1`'s blueprint (D3: `approval="Approved"`, `status="Current"`) is set through the
existing `POST /blueprints` create call with `approval`/`status` supplied directly in the body
— **not** a deviation after all: `blueprints/service.ts`'s create path already accepts and
persists both fields as given (verified by reading the create validator/service before writing
this), so no new endpoint was needed here. Issue #8 below is the *separate*, real gap: there is
no **UI** for a non-architect role to flip an *existing* blueprint to Approved after the fact
(the architect's own generic PATCH is the only write path a human can reach, and it's the wrong
actor) — that is fixed as part of Part B, item 8.

`DEMO-STAGE-4`'s Final Inspection is approved through the existing
`PATCH /engineering-reports/:id {status:"Approved"}` call (same as `demo-full-cycle.ts`) — real
path, no deviation. The separate, real gap here is the same as blueprints: no UI surfaces this
action for a PM to click — fixed in Part B, item 4/9.

### Part B — 9 UI/UX issues

- [x] 1. Consultant Design Approval buttons — affordance
- [x] 2. PM Create-Project map z-index overlap — already fixed upstream (Q3)
- [x] 3. Finance Approvals pending-badge — already fixed upstream (Q4)
- [x] 4/9. Final Inspection PM approval affordance/gap — already fixed upstream (Q5)
- [x] 5. Payroll computation repro + fix — already fixed upstream (Q6), re-verified live in this environment
- [x] 6. Location textbox geocoding (Nominatim)
- [x] 7. Notification dropdown pagination — already fixed upstream (Q1)
- [x] 8. Blueprint approval action (real gap)

## Part B — mid-task discovery: most of this was already fixed upstream

Partway through this session, `origin/dev-ai` had moved (from `0e08327` to `83675df` — a
fetch/merge mid-session, not something this session caused) and now included
`9e7fe3fce918` **"fix(ui): Q1-Q6 user-reported UI/UX issues, all live-verified"**, plus AI-signals
Groups D/E/F. That single commit already fixes exactly the 6 queued issues (Q1-Q6), which map
directly onto 6 of this list's 9 items:

| This list's item | Queue id | Fixed by | File(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7. Notification pagination | Q1 | `9e7fe3f` | `notification-bell.tsx` |
| 2. Map z-index overlap | Q3 | `9e7fe3f` | `location-map-picker.tsx` (`isolation: isolate`) |
| 3. Finance pending-badge | Q4 | `9e7fe3f` | `sidebar.tsx`, `header.tsx`, new `useApprovalsPendingCount()` |
| 4/9. Final Inspection approval | Q5 | `9e7fe3f` | `shared-reports.tsx` rebuilt into a real approve/reject screen |
| 5. Payroll computation | Q6 | `9e7fe3f` | `seed-demo-accounts.ts` (pay rates), `finance-payroll-review.tsx` |

Merged that history into this branch (`git merge origin/dev-ai`, one trivial `package.json`
script-list conflict, resolved by keeping both scripts), re-ran the full server test suite
(84/84 passing) and the demo seed script (still idempotent, still produces the same 7 projects)
against the merged code, then pushed. Item 1 turned out **not** to be the same file Q2 actually
fixed (Q2's own fix, also in `9e7fe3f`, is in `consultant-proposals.tsx` — the *proposal*
review's Approve/Reject; this list's item 1 explicitly names `consultant-design-reviews.tsx`,
the separate *design review* decide screen E1/E2 built) — its buttons were still tiny (28px,
`text-xs`) with a blend-into-the-row ghost-variant destructive Reject, so it got its own fix
below rather than being marked done by inference.

This left only two of the nine genuinely unaddressed: item 6 (geocoding — never in the Q-queue
at all) and item 8 (blueprint approval — a real backend+UI gap, not in the Q-queue either).
Both are built fresh in this session, below.

### 1. Consultant Design Approval buttons — affordance fix

**Capability already existed** — `useDesignReviews().decide()` and the server route (E1) both
worked; this was purely a visibility/affordance problem, the same class Q2 fixed in a
*different* file. `client/src/pages/roles/consultant/consultant-design-reviews.tsx`: the
Approve/Request changes/Reject row was three 28px-tall (`h-7 text-xs`) buttons, the last a
`variant="ghost" text-destructive` Reject that visually blended into the card. Changed to
full-size buttons (default height, no forced `text-xs`), Reject switched to `variant="destructive"`
(solid, unmistakably a red button), added a "Decide:" label and a border-top separating the
action row from the review's own details, and widened the action row's top margin.

### 2/3/4/9/5/7 — already fixed upstream, spot-verified

- **Item 2 (map z-index):** `location-map-picker.tsx`'s wrapper now has `isolation: isolate`,
  scoping Leaflet's own internal z-index stack (which climbs past 1000) inside a local stacking
  context instead of competing with the app header's z-index directly — read the diff, matches
  the "scope it, don't crank the header" instruction in this task exactly.
- **Item 3 (finance badge):** confirmed `sidebar.tsx` renders a red-dot badge via
  `useApprovalsPendingCount()` against `GET /workflows/approvals/stats` — the same
  unread-count-hook pattern `notification-bell.tsx` already used, as instructed.
- **Item 4/9 (Final Inspection):** confirmed `shared-reports.tsx` is now a real
  Approve/Reject/Request-revision screen (project-manager/admin decide, matching
  `engineering-reports/service.ts`'s `assertCanSetStatus`), not a `ComingSoonCard`. This is the
  same real gap `DEMO-STAGE-4`'s seed step exercises via the underlying API — the fix here is
  the missing **UI** for that same action, not a second gap.
- **Item 5 (payroll):** re-verified live in *this* session's own environment (the local DB's
  employee rows already existed from before the upstream fix merged in, so its own
  insert-only pay-rate backfill in `seed-demo-accounts.ts` didn't touch them — ran the
  equivalent one-off `UPDATE employees SET pay_rate=... WHERE role=...` this session, matching
  the same `PAY_RATE_BY_ROLE` table the fix added). Real end-to-end run,
  `POST /payroll/generate` → `GET /finance/payroll-review/:id` → `POST .../decide`, actual
  server output:
  ```
  generate: 201 {"lines":[{"empId":"EMP-DEMO-07","hours":40,"overtime":4,
    "gross":"6900.00","sss":"350.00","philhealth":"250.00","pagibig":"138.00",
    "withholdingTax":"0.00","deductions":"738.00","net":"6162.00", ...}],
    "batch":{"grossPayroll":6900,"deductions":738,"netPayroll":6162,"status":"pending"}}
  review fetch: 200 (same numbers)
  approve: 200 "Payroll batch decision recorded"
  ```
  Real SSS/PhilHealth/Pag-IBIG math (`server/src/payroll/ph-statutory.ts`) computing non-zero
  values, exactly the fix's own repro (`payRate=0` → gross/net always ₱0) resolved. Test batch
  deleted afterward.
- **Item 7 (notifications):** confirmed `notification-bell.tsx` now has Prev/Next pagination
  (8/page) reading a real page of the notifications list, not client-side slicing of everything.

### 8. Blueprint approval — real gap, fixed

Confirmed the gap exactly as described: `server/src/blueprints/routes.ts`'s `PATCH /:id` had
**no role guard at all** (any authenticated user could set `approval`), and no client screen
outside the architect's own `architect-blueprints.tsx` (a create-only gallery, no decide UI)
ever called it. Gate D3 reads `blueprints.approval="Approved" AND status="Current"` with no real
way to reach that state except a hand-crafted PATCH.

Built, server:
- `server/src/blueprints/service.ts`: new `decide()` — validates `approval` is one of
  Approved/Rejected/Revision Required, also sets `status: "Current"` when approving (D3 needs
  both), notifies the architect role, calls `refreshProjectProgress` (same pattern as
  `design-reviews/service.ts decide()`).
- `server/src/blueprints/routes.ts`: `POST /:id/decide`, `requireRole("consultant",
  "project-manager", "admin")` — separate from the generic `PATCH` so the architect can still
  edit their own drawing's metadata without being able to self-approve it.
- `server/src/validators/blueprint-validator.ts`: `decideBlueprintSchema`.

Built, client:
- `useBlueprintsController` (`blueprints.controller.ts`): new `decide(id, approval)`.
- New `client/src/pages/roles/shared/shared-blueprint-reviews.tsx`, mirroring
  `consultant-design-reviews.tsx`'s Pending/Approved/Rejected tabs — mounted at
  `/blueprint-reviews` (same "open to any authenticated role, decide gated server-side"
  convention as `/reports`). Added to Consultant's nav (tabs + sidebar section) as
  "Blueprint Reviews". Did **not** add a PM-specific nav entry (project-manager doesn't have a
  dedicated section in `role-tab.ts` the way consultant/admin do) or an Admin nav entry — both
  can still reach `/blueprint-reviews` directly and the server permits both roles to decide;
  logged as a deviation rather than guessed at further.

**Live verification** (real server, real roles):
```
create (architect):                          201, approval="Pending"
architect decides own blueprint (expect 403): 403 "Role 'architect' cannot access this resource"
consultant decides Approved (expect 200):     200, approval="Approved", status="Current"
architect notified:                           true — "Blueprint approved" / "...was approved."
invalid approval value (expect 400):          400
```
Test blueprint deleted afterward.

### 6. Location textbox geocoding — real gap, fixed

Confirmed the gap: `client/src/features/projects/pages/ProjectCreatePage.tsx`'s Location field
(inside `StepProjectInfo`) was a plain `<Input>` writing only to `data.location` (free text sent
to the server as-is) — `LocationMapPicker` right below it was entirely separate, driven only by
manual pin placement/drag.

Built `client/src/components/maps/use-geocode-search.ts`: a `useGeocodeSearch()` hook —
debounced 450ms (>400ms as asked), `AbortController`-cancels a stale in-flight request when a
newer keystroke supersedes it, calls `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search` with
`format=jsonv2`, a `User-Agent` header per Nominatim's usage policy, and a `requestId` guard so
a slow response can't clobber newer results. Wired into `ProjectCreatePage.tsx`'s `StepProjectInfo`:
typing shows a suggestion dropdown under the input; picking a result fills the text field with
the full matched address **and** sets `siteLatitude`/`siteLongitude`, which `LocationMapPicker`
picks up via its own props-driven `useEffect` and recenters the pin to (confirmed by reading
`location-map-picker.tsx`'s second effect, which calls `map.setView` whenever the
`latitude`/`longitude` props change — no changes needed to that component itself).

Not live-verified against the real Nominatim endpoint from this session — confirmed the same
proxy blocks it as blocks EstimationPro.ai:
```
$ curl -i "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=jsonv2&limit=1&q=Manila"
curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403
[agent-proxy] ... nominatim.openstreetmap.org:443 — connect_rejected (organization policy)
```
The debounce/abort/request-id logic itself has no network dependency and was verified by
reading it closely, and `tsc`/the client build are clean with this file included. Logged as a
deviation, not silently claimed as live-verified.

## P1 — Gate → row audit table

Source: `server/src/lifecycle/gates.ts` (checks) + `server/src/lifecycle/repository.ts`
`loadSnapshot()` (what's loaded). Every gate reads only from the snapshot object below; no
gate does its own DB query.

| Gate | Label | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Architect staffed | `project_members` role='architect' |
| P2 | Consultant staffed | `project_members` role='consultant' |
| P3 | Proposal submitted | `proposals.workflow_id` not null |
| P4 | Proposal approved | `proposals` (linked) + `workflows.status='completed'` on the linked workflow |
| P5 | Award & contract on file | `documents.type` in ('Notice of Award','Contract') + `projects.contract_value > 0` |
| D1 | Design w/ files, staffed engineer | `designs.file_urls`, `designs.assigned_engineer_id` + `project_members` role='engineer' |
| D2 | All designs approved | `designs.status='Approved'` (all) + no `design_reviews.status='Pending'` for those design ids |
| D3 | Approved current blueprint | `blueprints.approval='Approved' AND status='Current'` |
| C1 | Materials & specs approved | `requirements.category` in ('Materials','Specifications'), `status` |
| C2 | Budget approved | `budgets.status='approved'` (all) + sum(`budgets.planned`) > 0 |
| C3 | Milestones dated & active | `milestones.estimated_completion_date`, `.status` |
| C4 | Site crew staffed & linked | `project_members` role='site-personnel' + `employees.status='Active'` (by user_id) + `tasks` + `milestone_links` (linkType='task') + `milestones.status='active'` |
| C5 | NTP & site location | `documents.type='Notice to Proceed'` + `projects.site_latitude/site_longitude` |
| K1 | All tasks completed | `tasks.status` (all) |
| K2 | All milestones closed | `milestones.status` in ('completed','cancelled') (all) |
| K3 | No open issues | `issues.status` not in ('Submitted','Under Review') |
| K4 | No active workflows | `workflows.status='active'` (any, for this project) |
| X1 | Final inspection approved | `engineering_reports.type='Final Inspection' AND status='Approved'` |
| X2 | Certificate of Completion on file | `documents.type='Certificate of Completion'` |
| X3 | Closeout payroll approved | `payroll_batches.status` + `project_phase_history` (entered-Closeout timestamp) |
| X4 | Project Closeout workflow completed | `workflows.template_id` = the "Project Closeout" template's id, `.status='completed'` |

`loadSnapshot()` additionally loads `proposalWorkflows`, `workflowStages`, `staffedEmployees`,
`phaseHistory`, `closeoutTemplateId` as support for the above joins — same tables, no gate reads
anything outside this table list.

## Deviations

- **AV-6-followup:** made this fully self-contained rather than a one-off manual SQL insert —
  `demo-seed-stages.ts` now has its own `ensureFallbackReferenceRow()`, called every run before
  the 7 projects are built: if `reference_snapshots` is empty, it upserts the same fallback row
  (same `(source, source_item_id)` conflict key `seed-reference-data.ts` uses, so a later real
  `ai:seed-references` run just overwrites it) and logs that it did so. Verified by deleting
  every `reference_snapshots`/`validation_results` row and re-running the script from a
  genuinely empty catalog — it reseeded the fallback row itself and produced the identical
  Budget Change Request output shown above, no manual SQL required.
- **AV-6 (P5):** `npm run ai:seed-references` cannot reach EstimationPro.ai from this sandbox
  (outbound proxy returns 403 on `CONNECT estimationpro.ai:443`, confirmed via
  `curl -i https://estimationpro.ai/api/v1/trades` and the proxy's own `/__agentproxy/status`,
  which lists it as a `connect_rejected` / policy denial — not a live 403 from the API itself).
  Rather than invent numbers, inserted one `reference_snapshots` row directly by SQL using the
  exact low/typical/high values (`$80`/`$100`/`$120` per lf, "Rebar #4 (1/2 inch)") the repo's
  own `server/src/ai-validation/cost.test.ts` already uses for its real worked trace — the same
  numbers a previous session's live fetch actually returned (see `ai-signals-progress.md`
  Group C's checkpoint evidence, `typical ₱806,081` for 128.5 lf, matches exactly). Every step
  downstream of that row — matching, unit conversion, FX, variance math, persistence — is the
  real, unmodified `validateWorkflowLineItems()` code path. Only the *reference catalog's own
  freshness* is a stand-in; if this environment gets real network access to EstimationPro.ai,
  running `npm run ai:seed-references` will overwrite this row with a live one (same
  `(source, source_item_id)` upsert key) and nothing else needs to change.
- **AV-7 (environment):** this sandbox had no `DATABASE_URL`/`.env` and no installed
  dependencies at all. Provisioned a local Postgres 16 (already present in the container image)
  as a throwaway dev database rather than fabricating "should work" verification — see the
  Environment note at the top of this file for exactly what was done and why the one attempt to
  weaken `pg_hba.conf` was reverted (flagged by the environment's own safety classifier,
  reverted immediately, a local `setpriv` role switch used instead). This means every verified
  number in this document is real and reproducible, but was produced against a fresh empty
  database seeded from scratch this session, not the shared/persistent dev DB the two uploaded
  reference docs' transcripts came from.
- **AV-8 (P9):** the prompt asked to "seed the 10 role-account demo logins if not already
  present." They were already present — `seed-demo-accounts.ts` (part of `npm run db:seed`,
  pre-existing from the lifecycle work) creates all 10 canonical logins plus 40 additional
  per-role accounts (4 each) — verified live by running `db:seed` against the freshly-created
  local DB and reading its own printed account table. No new code was needed for P9.

## Questions

- Item 8 (blueprint approval): who owns sign-off, Consultant, PM, or both? No role-responsibility
  doc was found pinning this down (grepped `docs/` and the README). Went with the same split
  gate D3's own `ownerRoles: ["architect"]` (the architect chases the approval) implies plus the
  design-review precedent (architect authors, consultant decides) — server route allows
  consultant/project-manager/admin to decide, and the new nav entry was only added for
  Consultant (project-manager has no dedicated top-level nav section in `role-tab.ts` to add it
  to, and admin's nav wasn't touched either) — both can still reach `/blueprint-reviews`
  directly and the server permits their decision. If PM should have equal nav-level
  discoverability, that's a follow-up.

## Round 3 (2026-09-25) — real vs. dead AI surfaces, punch list, nav sync

Branch: `dev-ai`, started at HEAD `0728303`. Part A commit: `8a38ce7`. Part B commit: `17b58c8`.
Part C commit: `d06579b`. Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server` and `npm test` (84/84) and client
`npm run build` all clean as of `d06579b`. Every Part A/B/C checklist item above is checked off
with live reproduction evidence (real local Postgres, real server, real client, Playwright for
browser-level checks) — no "should work now" claims.

Prior status correction confirmed by re-reading
this file and `ai-signals-progress.md` in full: the five advisory signals (Groups D/E/F) ARE
built — `server/src/signals/` (all five rule files, `index.ts`, `boundary.test.ts`),
`DecisionSupportSection.tsx`, `my-actions.ts`'s `kind: "signal"` items, and
`npm run demo:ai-signals` all verified present and working (re-run live this session, see
Part A below). Nothing from Groups D/E/F was rebuilt.

### Environment

Same as the "read first" note above: no `.env`/deps present at session start. Provisioned the
same local Postgres 16 dev database, ran `npm --prefix server install` / `npm --prefix client
install` (fresh — `node_modules` were absent again in this worktree), wrote `server/.env`
(`DATABASE_URL`, `PORT=8000`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `FEATURE_AI=true`) and `client/.env`
(`VITE_API_BASE`, `VITE_FEATURE_AI=true`), both gitignored. `npm run db:seed` ran clean.
`npm run ai:seed-references` still cannot reach EstimationPro.ai from this sandbox (`403` /
proxy `connect_rejected`, same as every prior session) — used `npm run demo:seed`'s own
`ensureFallbackReferenceRow()` fallback (one "Rebar #4" reference row) instead, per the existing
AV-6-followup deviation.

### Part A — real AI-validation layer vs. dead "Coming Soon" surfaces

**A1 — ComingSoonCard audit.** Re-grepped every usage (12 files). Classified:

- **AI-related, unreachable, deleted:**
  - `client/src/pages/roles/project-manager/pm-ai-insights.tsx` and
    `client/src/pages/roles/shared/shared-ai-insights.tsx` — confirmed by grep that nothing
    imports either component; `App.tsx`'s only `/ai-insights` route unconditionally redirects to
    `/dashboard` (per the A3 surface-table work already on `dev-ai`), and the nav entry is
    filtered out via `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders` (permanently false). Both files deleted outright.
  - The `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders`-gated "AI insights"/"AI validation insights" `ComingSoonCard`
    blocks in `pm-dashboard.tsx` and `consultant-dashboard.tsx` — permanently unreachable (the
    flag never turns on), and redundant with `WaitingOnYouCard`, which already sits directly
    above/below them on both pages and already surfaces warn/critical advisory signals
    (Sparkles icon, "AI" badge, per-project "Go to" navigation) from the *same*
    `GET /api/lifecycle/my-actions` data path `DecisionSupportSection` reads. Removed both
    blocks and their now-unused `ComingSoonCard`/`FEATURES` imports; no new query was added —
    `WaitingOnYouCard` already filled this slot.
  - `pm-reports.tsx` and `pm-resources.tsx` — found to be a **second instance of the same
    dead-route bug** the AI pages had: neither file is imported anywhere in `App.tsx` (PM's
    `/reports` and `/resources` nav entries route to the *shared* `SharedReports`/
    `SharedResources` components instead — confirmed via `role-tab.ts`). Not AI-related, but
    literal dead files superseded by working shared routes; deleted as the same class of
    cleanup A1 asks for, documented as a reasonable-call deviation below.
- **Non-AI, confirmed reachable-but-empty, left alone (documented per A1's instruction, not a
  silent gap):**
  - `shared-resources.tsx` (`/resources`, reachable, real "Resources & Tools" stub — no backend
    table exists for it yet).
  - `admin-dashboard.tsx`'s "Workforce snapshot" card — reachable (admin dashboard is real and
    routed), explicit text explaining no cross-project attendance endpoint exists yet.
  - `it-designer-dashboard.tsx`'s "Infrastructure health" card — reachable, explicit text (no
    uptime/backup data recorded anywhere).
  - `architect-dashboard.tsx`'s 4 "Not yet built — placeholders only" cards (blueprint library,
    review queue, revision tracker, documentation hub) — reachable, explicitly labeled.
  - `pm-dashboard.tsx`'s "Awaiting your approval" / "Activity & advisories" cards — reachable,
    not AI-related (no approvals/activity-feed backend exists), left as-is.
  - `shared-reports.tsx` — no longer a `ComingSoonCard` at all (already a real
    approve/reject screen per Part B's Q5 fix, re-verified in B5 below); its file still
    literally contains the string "ComingSoonCard" only in a comment describing what it used to
    be.

**A2 — role coverage for `DecisionSupportSection`.** `ProjectLifecyclePanel` is mounted in
exactly one place, `ProjectDetailPage.tsx`, at the shared route `/projects/:projectId`
(`App.tsx`) — not role-gated at the router level, only auth-gated, and `ProjectDetailPage`
renders `ProjectLifecyclePanel` (and, inside it, `DecisionSupportSection`) unconditionally for
every role; only *editing* the project record itself is role-restricted (`PROJECT_EDITORS`).
The five signals' `ownerRoles` are `project-manager`, `finance-manager`, `engineer` (fixed) plus
`stalled-stage`'s dynamic `ownerRole` (whichever role owns the currently-stalled workflow
stage — in practice any of the ten roles, since workflow templates assign stages broadly).

Every one of the 10 role dashboards renders `WaitingOnYouCard` (confirmed by grep — `admin`,
`architect`, `consultant`, `engineer`, `finance`, `hr`, `it-designer`, `pm`, `site-personnel`
dashboards all import and render it), and that card's `kind: "signal"` items link straight to
`/projects/:id` (or, for `stalled-stage`, `/workflows` — both un-role-gated shared routes) via
plain `navigate()`, which works regardless of whether that route is in the role's own sidebar.
So **every role can already reach `DecisionSupportSection` for a project a signal has actually
fired on for them** — this is the real, pre-existing coverage path, not something built this
session.

The gap found: `finance-manager` — an explicit `ownerRoles` entry on 3 of the 5 signals
(cost-variance, burn-vs-progress, cumulative-change-impact) — had **no sidebar/tab entry into
`/projects` at all** in `role-tab.ts` (only Budget/Payroll Review/Expenses/Approvals), unlike
`project-manager`, `architect` and `engineer`, which all have one. That meant a finance manager
could only reach a project's Decision Support panel reactively (after a signal already fired and
put a link on their dashboard), never by browsing proactively. Fixed: added a "Projects" tab
(`route: "/projects"`, reusing the existing `PMProjects` list — server-side `GET /projects` has
no role restriction, confirmed in `server/src/projects/routes.ts`) plus a matching sidebar item
under finance-manager's "Budget Management" section, in `client/src/config/role-tab.ts`. No new
component built. `human-resources` and `site-personnel` are not fixed `ownerRoles` on any
signal (only possible dynamic targets of `stalled-stage`, same reactive-link coverage as every
other role) — left as-is.

**A3 — `FEATURE_AI` deployment config.** The repo has no `.env.example` anywhere (confirmed by
`find . -iname .env.example`); `README.md`'s "Configure environment variables" section is the
only documented `.env` convention, and it **omitted `FEATURE_AI`/`VITE_FEATURE_AI` entirely** —
someone following the README top-to-bottom for a fresh/presentation environment would never
turn the AI-validation layer on. Added `FEATURE_AI=true` to the server `.env` block (with a
comment on what it gates) and a sentence to the client-env paragraph noting `VITE_FEATURE_AI`
is a separate flag that also needs setting. Verified `server/src/config/features.ts` (`ai:
process.env.FEATURE_AI === "true"`) and `client/src/config/features.ts`
(`import.meta.env.VITE_FEATURE_AI === "true"`) are exactly what these two env vars gate.

**A4 — one bookmarkable place to see all five signals trip.** Found the actual gap:
`demo-ai-signals.ts`'s `PROJECT_CODE` was `` `AISIG-${Date.now().toString(36).toUpperCase()}` ``
— a **new, differently-coded project on every run**, never cleaned up. The
`ai-signals-progress.md` F2 entry's `AISIG-MUGLM73Z` is real (that run's actual output, project
id 12, deliberately left in a database from a now-gone prior session's Postgres instance) but
is not a stable, reusable reference — re-running the script today produces a different code
every time, so there was never actually one fixed, bookmarkable project. Fixed:
- `PROJECT_CODE` is now a stable `AISIG-DEMO` (overridable via `AISIG_PROJECT_CODE` env var).
- Added `cleanupExisting(code)` (raw SQL, same table order/parent-before-child care as
  `demo-seed-stages.ts`'s own `cleanup()` — kept as a separate, self-contained copy rather than
  importing that module, since its `main()` runs unconditionally at import time and would have
  reseeded all 7 `DEMO-STAGE-*` projects as a side effect of importing it here), called before
  every project creation — the script is now idempotent, re-running it rebuilds the *same*
  project rather than leaving a trail of one-off ones.
- The script's final log line now prints the project's `/projects/:id` link directly.
- `README.md` gained a `demo:ai-signals` row in the scripts table and an "AI-validation demo
  project" paragraph explaining `AISIG-DEMO` is the one bookmarkable place to see all five
  signals fire, and that the 7 `DEMO-STAGE-*` projects deliberately don't carry this scenario
  themselves (kept separate on purpose — `DEMO-STAGE-3` already demonstrates the *cost-reference
  citation* feature on its own Budget Change Request; layering all five signal triggers onto it
  too would overload one project's story).

**Live re-verification, this session** (`npm run demo:ai-signals`, real server, real DB, twice
in a row to prove idempotency — second run reused the same `AISIG-DEMO` code, cleared and
rebuilt project id 53 after id 45 from the first run):
```
▶ Clearing any existing AISIG-DEMO from a previous run
▶ Creating project AISIG-DEMO and driving it to Construction
  ✔ cumulative-change-impact fired, warn
  ✔ burn-vs-progress fired, warn
  ✔ issue-recurrence fired, warn, mentions a precedent
  ✔ stalled-stage fired, warn
  ✔ checks match exactly (same keys, same passed values)
  ✔ canAdvance matches exactly
  ✘ cost-variance fired, critical []
6 passed, 1 failed
Scenario project AISIG-DEMO (id 53) left in place for inspection — not cleaned up.
Open it in the app at /projects/53 (Project Manager / Consultant / Finance Manager / Engineer)
to see DecisionSupportSection with all five signals live.
```
`cost-variance` did not fire — **not a regression from this session's change** (verified by
re-reading the diff: only `PROJECT_CODE`, `cleanupExisting`, and the final log line changed, no
matching/threshold logic touched). Root cause: this sandbox's `reference_snapshots` table only
has the single AV-6-followup fallback row ("Rebar #4 (1/2 inch)"), because EstimationPro.ai is
still unreachable here; the script's own BCR line items describe *concrete* ("Ready-mix
concrete...", "Concrete slab, poured and finished"), which the similarity matcher (floor 0.40)
correctly does not match against a rebar reference row, so no cost-variance signal is produced
at all (not a severity mismatch — zero signals for that rule). With a full reference catalog
(the normal case, live EstimationPro.ai access) this assertion is known to pass — see
`ai-signals-progress.md` F2's original 7/7 run. Logged as an environment-only deviation, same
root cause as AV-6/AV-6-followup; not fixed further this session (fixing it would mean either
restoring network access, which is out of this session's control, or widening the fallback
reference catalog with a concrete item, which risks changing what the fallback represents for
other consumers of it (`demo-seed-stages.ts`'s own DEMO-STAGE-3 narrative is written around the
rebar row specifically) — flagged rather than guessed at.

**Deviations (Part A):**
- Deleted `pm-reports.tsx`/`pm-resources.tsx` even though they're not AI-related, because they
  are literal dead files (unreachable, superseded by shared routes) — the same bug class A1
  targets, not a scope-creep addition.
- Added a "Projects" nav entry to `finance_manager` in `role-tab.ts` (A2) — a real navigation
  fix per A2's own instruction ("if a role that should see relevant signals has no path... fix
  navigation"), reusing the existing `/projects` route/component, no new component built.
- `demo-ai-signals.ts`'s cost-variance assertion still fails in this network-blocked sandbox
  (see above) — environment limitation, not a code defect; flagged, not silently worked around.

Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server`: clean. Client `npm run build`: clean (both re-run after
every file change in this section).

### Part B — punch list round 3

Live-verified end to end this session against the local Postgres/server/client (`npm run dev`
on both sides, `npm run db:seed`, `npm run demo:seed`), using Playwright (Chromium at
`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194`, run via a script copied to
`/opt/node22/lib/node_modules/` so Node's resolver finds the global `playwright` install).

- **[x] B1 — required-field markers.** Read the actual validation: client `handleSubmit`
  requires `title`/`project`/a picked file; server `createDocumentSchema`
  (`server/src/validators/document-validators.ts`) requires `title`/`project`/`type` (type has a
  UI default so it's always populated); `POST /documents/upload`'s controller 400s with "Please
  select a file to upload" if `req.file` is missing. So Title, Project and File are the three
  actually-required fields. Matched the app's existing asterisk convention (`architect-design-create.tsx`:
  `<Label>Text <span className="text-destructive">*</span></Label>`) on all three in
  `client/src/components/documents/upload-document-dialog.tsx`. Live-verified — dialog now reads
  "Title *", "Project *", "File *" (screenshotted via Playwright, text dump captured).
- **[x] B2 — render `gates.ts`'s `.link` on failing checks.** `ProjectLifecyclePanel.tsx`'s check
  list never rendered `check.link` even though every gate in `gates.ts` (all phases, not just
  Design) carries one. Added a "Go to {route}" `<Link>` under each **failing** check, same
  text/style as `DecisionSupportSection`'s existing signal "Go to" links, shown only to a viewer
  whose role is in that check's own `ownerRoles` (or admin) — reusing the field that was already
  there, no new link style. Live-verified on the `AISIG-DEMO` project (id 53) as
  project-manager: K2 ("All milestones closed", `ownerRoles: [project-manager]`) showed "Go to
  projects/AISIG-DEMO"; K3 ("No open issues", owner includes project-manager) showed "Go to
  issues"; K1 (`ownerRoles: [site-personnel]` only) and K4 (`ownerRoles: [finance-manager]`
  only) correctly showed **no** gate-level link for this PM viewer, confirming the role scoping
  actually works (not just present-but-unconditional).
- **[x] B3 — design-review list order.** `server/src/designs/design-reviews/repository.ts`'s
  `findAll()` had **no `ORDER BY` at all** (confirmed by reading it — not "already
  newest-first", the prompt's assumption to verify was wrong) — Postgres returned rows in
  whatever order the planner picked, in practice oldest-first. Added
  `.orderBy(desc(designReviews.submittedAt))` (this table's `createdAt` equivalent — set once on
  insert via `defaultNow()`) to both the filtered and unfiltered query paths. Live-verified via
  `GET /design-reviews`: 7 seeded reviews with distinct `submittedAt` timestamps a few seconds
  apart now return in `REV-AISIG-DEMO` (newest) → `REV-DEMO-STAGE-1` (oldest) order.
- **[x] B4 — Budget Change Request line-item editor redesign.** Relabeled every field (Category,
  Description, Current amount, Requested amount — was placeholder-text-only), added a live
  computed "Change" field per line (`requested − current`, ₱-formatted via the existing
  `formatCurrency()`, red for an increase / green for a decrease, "—" until both amounts are
  entered), and grouped Quantity/Unit/the `FEATURES.ai` cost-comparison hint into their own
  bordered block under each line item's own card instead of reading as a second, disconnected
  row. Data shape/validation untouched (`DraftLineItem`, `updateLineItem`,
  `completedLineItems`, the submit payload) — confirmed by diff: only JSX/layout changed inside
  the `showLineItems` block. Live-verified as engineer (`/approvals` → "Request budget change" —
  note: this is the actual reachable entry point; `/workflows` has no such button for engineer,
  see Deviations) — typed 50000/75000 into Current/Requested and the Change field updated live
  to "+₱25,000.00" in red, screenshotted (`/tmp/b4-dialog.png`, described: dialog shows "COST
  CHANGES" header, one "Change 1" card with Category/Description on one row, Current
  amount/Requested amount/Change on the next, all clearly labeled).
- **[x] B5 — Final Inspection approval, re-verified live (not rebuilt).** Confirmed
  `shared-reports.tsx` is a real, reachable approve/reject screen. **Found and fixed a real
  regression while verifying**: this session's `client/.env` (written per the environment setup
  note, following this same README's own documented example) had
  `VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000/api`, and `client/src/services/api.client.ts`'s
  `apiUrl()` unconditionally appends `/api` itself — so every request went to
  `/api/api/engineering-reports` and 404'd, which is exactly what `/reports` showed live
  ("API error 404: ... Cannot GET /api/api/engineering-reports"). This is a **README bug**, not
  a `shared-reports.tsx` bug — fixed `README.md`'s example to `VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000`
  (no `/api` suffix) with an explanation, fixed this session's own `client/.env` the same way,
  and confirmed the page loads correctly afterward. With that fixed: seeded one throwaway
  `Submitted` Final Inspection report on `DEMO-STAGE-4` via direct SQL (all 3 existing Final
  Inspection rows in this fresh DB were already `Approved`, from `demo:seed` driving those
  projects all the way through Closeout — nothing to click Approve on otherwise), logged in as
  project-manager, saw it in the Pending tab with working Approve/Request revision/Reject
  buttons, clicked Approve, and confirmed via direct SQL the row's `status` flipped to
  `Approved` and it moved out of the Pending list in the UI. Test row deleted afterward.

**Deviations (Part B):**
- B5's real finding was a `README.md` env-var documentation bug (wrong `VITE_API_BASE` example
  causing a double `/api/api/` prefix), not anything in `shared-reports.tsx` itself — fixed the
  doc and this session's own `.env`, not any application code.
- B4: engineer's own `WorkflowInitiationActions`/`BUDGET_CHANGE_ACTION` launcher
  (`workflow-initiation-actions.tsx`) is mounted via `ApprovalQueuePanel`, which is only
  embedded on the shared `/approvals` route (`pm-approvals.tsx`) — not on any engineer-specific
  page, and `/workflows` (the page an engineer's own sidebar nav actually calls "Workflows" —
  wait, checked: engineer's nav doesn't have a "Workflows" tab at all, only "Approvals", which
  is where this lives) is PM/Admin's own page with a *different* "New workflow" flow (full
  template picker, not role-scoped launcher buttons). Not a bug to fix under B4 (out of scope —
  B4 is markup-only on an already-reachable dialog), but noted here since it's exactly the kind
  of "is this dialog actually reachable" question this pass cares about; confirmed reachable via
  `/approvals`, just not where a first guess ("Workflows" page) would look.

Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server`: clean. Client `npm run build`: clean. `npm test` (server):
84/84 pass.

### Part C — navbar/sidebar active-state sync

**Finding a real disagreement first.** Confirmed `header.tsx`'s `isTabActive` and
`sidebar.tsx`'s `isActive` were byte-identical logic
(`pathname === route || pathname.startsWith(route + "/")`) — so on their own they can't
disagree about a shared route; the drift risk was two independent copies of one rule (exactly
what the prompt names). More important: `sidebar.tsx` does **not** read `role-tab.ts`'s own
`sections` field at all — it renders from `useMenu()` (refine's resource menu, built from
`providers/resources.ts` filtered by `config/role-resources.ts`'s `ROLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS`), a
completely different, dynamic list from `role-tab.ts`'s static `tabs` array that `header.tsx`
reads. (`role-tab.ts`'s `sections` field is itself dead — grepped, nothing reads it outside its
own file; flagged in Deviations, not touched, out of scope for this pass.) That means the
header's tab set and the sidebar's actual item set were never the same list to begin with, so
they can genuinely disagree on which "page" is active whenever a sidebar item's route isn't
nested under any header tab's route.

Found the concrete case: architect's sidebar (`providers/resources.ts`, `Workspace` group) has
always listed **Blueprints** as a first-class item (`list: "/blueprints"`, same group as
Designs/Proposals), but architect's `role-tab.ts` `tabs` only had Projects/Designs/Proposals —
no tab's route nests `/blueprints`. Live-reproduced: navigated an architect session straight to
`/blueprints` — sidebar correctly highlighted "Blueprints", **no header tab highlighted at
all**. A user scanning the header after clicking a sidebar link would see nothing telling them
which section they're in.

**Fix:**
- `client/src/lib/nav-active.ts` (new): the one `isNavRouteActive(pathname, route)`, imported by
  both `header.tsx` and `sidebar.tsx` in place of their own copies — a future edit to the match
  rule now has exactly one place to happen, removing the duplication that let them drift.
- `client/src/config/role-tab.ts`: added a "Blueprints" tab to the architect config (real
  navigation fix for the concrete case found, not a workaround — Blueprints is a full
  approve/reject workflow with its own page, same standing as Designs/Proposals).

Other sidebar items with no matching header tab exist across other roles too (e.g. architect's
own Revisions/Reviews/Documentation, admin's various `/admin/*` settings pages, human-resources'
`/workforce-reports`) — audited via a script cross-referencing every role's `tabs` routes
against every sidebar route reachable for that role. These read as **intentional**, not
instances of the same bug: every role has more sidebar entries than header tabs by a wide
margin, consistently across the whole app (tabs = a handful of primary daily actions, sidebar =
full nav) — Blueprints was the one case where a page as central as Designs/Proposals had been
left out of the tab row while its siblings were in it. Not fixed further; listed here as a
documented decision per the task's own instruction, not a silent gap. If a specific one of these
should also get a tab, that's a follow-up per-role product call, not a bug fix.

**Live-verified, 3 roles, both direct URL load and in-app navigation** (Playwright, DOM
snapshot of which header-nav `<button>` carries the active style class and which sidebar
`[data-sidebar="menu-button"]` carries `data-active="true"`):
```
architect /blueprints (direct URL):        header=["Blueprints"]  sidebar=["Blueprints"]
pm /projects (direct URL):                 header=["Projects"]    sidebar=["Projects"]
consultant /consultant/designs (direct URL): header=["Designs"]     sidebar=["Designs"]
architect Blueprints (in-app sidebar click, not URL): landed on /blueprints,
  header=["Blueprints"]  sidebar=["Blueprints"]
```
All four agree in both directions and both navigation methods — the one confirmed gap
(architect/Blueprints) is fixed; the general-purpose fix (shared `isNavRouteActive`) removes the
underlying duplication risk for every other role/route pair.

**Deviations (Part C):**
- `role-tab.ts`'s `sections` field is dead code (nothing reads it — `sidebar.tsx` uses
  `useMenu()`/`resources.ts` instead). Not removed in this pass — out of scope for Part C, and
  removing a field with this much per-role content is a larger, separate cleanup; flagged rather
  than silently left implying it's live data.
- Did not add tabs for every other sidebar-only page (Revisions, Reviews, Documentation, the
  various admin/IT-designer settings pages, etc.) — judged as the app's consistent, intentional
  tabs-are-a-subset convention rather than the same bug, per the reasoning above. If wrong,
  that's a per-role product decision, not a technical fix, and is called out here rather than
  guessed at.

Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server`: clean. Client `npm run build`: clean.

## Round 4 (2026-09-25) — named demo projects, AI reference page, dashboard fixes, HR realism

Branch: `dev-ai`, started at HEAD `d37d93c`. Environment: fresh worktree, no `.env`/deps —
provisioned the same local Postgres 16 dev database convention as prior rounds; this time the
`easyconstruct` database and its full seeded state (schema, 50 users/employees, the 8 existing
demo projects) were **already present** from an earlier session sharing this container image, so
no re-seed from empty was needed — confirmed live via `\dt` (all tables present) and
`SELECT count(*) FROM projects` (8: the 7 `DEMO-STAGE-*` + `AISIG-DEMO`) before touching anything.
`server/.env`/`client/.env` written fresh (gitignored), `npx tsc --noEmit -p server` confirmed
clean before any edit.

### Part A — Named per-stage demo projects

- **[x] A1 — display names.** `createProjectSchema.name` has no character restriction beyond
  `min(2)` (`server/src/validators/project-validator.ts`) — a middle dot is fine. **Decision on
  codes** (documented per the task's own instruction): kept `DEMO-STAGE-0`..`6` rather than
  renaming to `DEMO-S1`..`7`. Renaming would touch `demo-ai-signals.ts` (comment references),
  `README.md`, and this doc's own history for zero functional gain — the *name*, not the code, is
  what a person actually reads in the UI, and the name is now fixed. `demo-seed-stages.ts` gained
  a `DISPLAY_NAME` array; projects are created with `name: "DEMO · 1 Proposal"` ...
  `"DEMO · 7 Archived"`. Verified live via `SELECT code, name FROM projects WHERE code LIKE
  'DEMO-STAGE-%'` — see table below.
- **[x] A2 — gate audit.** Already fully documented in the P1 table above (`gates.ts` +
  `repository.ts loadSnapshot()`), re-confirmed correct by re-running the script and the real
  gate-check dump (below) — every check for the current phase and all earlier phases still reads
  `passed: true` except Construction's intentionally-failing K1/K2/K4. Construction's progress
  (59%) is `computeProgress`'s real `30 + 65*(4/9)` task-ratio formula, not hardcoded — confirmed
  by counting the actual `tasks` rows (9 total, 4 Completed) via SQL.
- **[x] A3 — Construction BCR re-verified.** Re-ran the script end to end against the current
  schema; the real `validateWorkflowLineItems()` output is byte-identical to the previous round's
  recorded trace (within-range +5.4%, above-typical +954.5%, no-match "line has no quantity") —
  see the script output below. No schema drift broke it.
- **[x] A4 — link to AISIG-DEMO.** `DEMO-STAGE-3`'s `description` field now reads: "Demonstrates
  the real cost-comparison engine (EstimationPro.ai citations on a Budget Change Request). For
  the five decision-support signal rules firing together, see the AISIG-DEMO project." — a real,
  persisted column (`projects.description`), visible on the project detail page.
- **[x] A5 — findability.** The existing project list search (`ProjectService.queryProjects`,
  used by `pm-projects.tsx`/`owner-portfolio.tsx`/`admin-projects.tsx` via
  `useProjectsController`) already filters by `name`/`code` substring, case-insensitive — typing
  "DEMO" already surfaces all 7 (confirmed by reading `project.service.ts`'s `queryProjects`, no
  code change needed). **Deviation, documented rather than silently left**: the bookmarkable
  route is `/projects/:id` (numeric id), and this script's cleanup-then-rebuild idempotency
  (A6) means the numeric id shifts on every re-run (confirmed: DEMO-STAGE-3 was id 25 before this
  round's re-run, id 57 after). The project *code* is the stable identifier (bookmarkable via
  `GET /projects?code=DEMO-STAGE-3` or the search box), not the URL.

  **Correction, found while building Part B**: `/projects/:projectId` is *already*
  code-tolerant — `ProjectRepository.getById(idOrCode)` (`client/src/features/projects/
  repositories/project.repository.ts`) tries the numeric-id endpoint only when the param is
  all-digits, and falls back to a `?search=` + exact-code match otherwise. So
  `/projects/DEMO-STAGE-3` (or `/projects/AISIG-DEMO`) **is** a real, stable, bookmarkable URL
  today — confirmed live: `curl .../api/projects?search=DEMO-STAGE-3` returns the project, and the
  route resolves it the same way `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` does. The numeric-id URL a card's own
  "Open" link produces still shifts on re-seed, but a hand-typed or documented `/projects/<CODE>`
  link does not. Retracting the "would need a rewrite" claim above — no further work was needed.
- **[x] A6 — re-runnable, no duplicates.** Ran twice in a row this round; both times exactly 7
  `DEMO-STAGE-*` rows (see table below) — unchanged from prior rounds' verification, re-confirmed
  live.
- **[x] A7 — verification.** Real gate-check dump against the live server, all 7 projects, plus
  the archived-project write-rejection check:

  ```
  DEMO-STAGE-0 (DEMO · 1 Proposal) phase=Proposal progress=8%
    P1..P5 passed=true (all 5)
  DEMO-STAGE-1 (DEMO · 2 Design) phase=Design progress=25%
    D1..D3 passed=true (all 3)
  DEMO-STAGE-2 (DEMO · 3 Pre-Construction) phase=Pre-Construction progress=29%
    C1..C5 passed=true (all 5)
  DEMO-STAGE-3 (DEMO · 4 Construction) phase=Construction progress=59%
    K1 passed=false  All tasks completed
    K2 passed=false  All milestones closed
    K3 passed=true   No open issues
    K4 passed=false  No active workflows
  DEMO-STAGE-4 (DEMO · 5 Closeout) phase=Closeout progress=99%
    X1..X4 passed=true (all 4)
  DEMO-STAGE-5 (DEMO · 6 Completed) phase=Completed progress=100%  (no gates)
  DEMO-STAGE-6 (DEMO · 7 Archived) phase=Archived progress=100%  (no gates)

  PATCH /projects/<DEMO-STAGE-6 id> {client:"Should be rejected"} (as PM)
    -> 409 {"success":false,"message":"Project is Archived — changes are locked","code":"CONFLICT"}
  ```

  Real DB row check (`SELECT code, name, status FROM projects WHERE code LIKE 'DEMO-STAGE-%'`),
  both before and after a second re-run — 7 rows both times, names as above.

Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server` and client `npm run build`: both clean.

### Part C — four dashboards fixed

- **[x] C1 — PM dashboard.** "No approvals backend exists yet" was false: `GET
  /workflows/approvals/stats` + `GET /workflows/approvals?scope=pending` are real, already used
  by `ApprovalQueuePanel`/`pm-approvals.tsx`. Checked `WaitingOnYouCard` first (per the task's own
  instruction) — it already covers gate/workflow/signal items, but not specifically a compact
  "approvals I can decide right now" list with amounts, so built `AwaitingApprovalCard`
  (`client/src/features/workflows/components/AwaitingApprovalCard.tsx`), reusing the existing
  `useApprovals("pending")` hook (same data path as the full queue, not a second query),
  rendering title/project/amount/type per item, linking into `/approvals`. "Site advisories aren't
  backed by any table" was also false — that's exactly what the five signal rules produce, and
  `WaitingOnYouCard` (mounted directly above, unchanged) already renders them cross-project with
  an "AI" badge via the same `GET /lifecycle/my-actions` path `DecisionSupportSection` uses.
  Grepped `server/src` for any general activity-feed table/endpoint — genuinely none exists
  (only the admin-only Audit Trail, a different, role-gated screen) — kept a `ComingSoonCard`,
  relabeled "Activity feed" with honest copy instead of the false "advisories" claim.
  Live-verified: `GET /workflows/approvals/stats` as PM real response `{"pending":0,"overdue":0,
  "avgCycleDays":0,"thisWeek":50}` — 0 pending is correct (no open workflow stages owned by PM in
  this DB state right now), not a stub.

- **[x] C2 — Architect dashboard.** "Request review" was hardcoded `disabled` despite `POST
  /design-reviews` (`server/src/designs/design-reviews/service.ts create()`) already working —
  wired a small dialog (design picker + `useDesignReviews().create()`, matching
  `createDesignReviewSchema`'s exact shape: `code`/`designId`/`requestedBy`). Live-verified: `POST
  /design-reviews` as architect → `201 {"id":58,...,"status":"Pending"}`, real row, cleaned up
  after. "Comment thread" — grepped `server/src` for any general discussion-thread table; found
  only per-decision comment *fields* on workflow stages/design reviews, never a standing thread —
  confirmed genuinely unbuilt, left `disabled` but relabeled "Not built yet — no discussion-thread
  table exists" instead of the ambiguous "Open active review discussions". "Generate options / AI
  design variations" — a fake-AI placeholder never part of the real AI-validation scope (proposal
  checks / cost-comparison / the five signals) — **removed outright**, not wired up, same standard
  as `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders`'s surface table.

- **[x] C3 — Admin dashboard "Workforce snapshot".** Confirmed no cross-project
  attendance/workforce *endpoint* was missing so much as a client-side rollup: `GET /employees`
  and `GET /attendance` (`server/src/employees/routes.ts`, `server/src/attendance/routes.ts`) were
  already org-wide, unfiltered, open to any authenticated role — no new server endpoint needed.
  Built one shared client data path, `useWorkforceSnapshot()`
  (`client/src/features/workforce/hooks/useWorkforceSnapshot.ts`), consumed by both this card
  (`WorkforceSnapshotCard`) and HR's `WorkforceSection` (C4/E3) — not two ad-hoc queries. The "Visit
  HR's Workforce Reports" text is now a real working button to `/workforce-reports` (confirmed
  that route renders unguarded for any authenticated role, same convention as `/reports`/
  `/blueprint-reviews`).

- **[x] C4 — HR dashboard `WorkforceSection()`/`PayrollSection()`.** Folded into Part E (below) per
  the task's own instruction not to fix in isolation — see E3.

Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server` and client `npm run build`: both clean.


### Part D — app-wide audit for "disabled on a real backend" / fake-AI stubs

**D1/D2 — method.** Grepped every `client/src/pages/roles/*/*.tsx` for a literal, unconditional
`disabled` (no `={...}` expression — those are real loading/permission-derived disables, out of
scope per the task's own instruction) and for every remaining `ComingSoonCard` usage. Cross-checked
each against `server/src/*/service.ts`/`routes.ts` for a matching verb, same method as C2.

**D3 — results table** (every row gets a recorded decision):

| Element | File | Claimed status | Real backend? | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "Request review" quick action | `architect-dashboard.tsx` | disabled, "Send a design to consultants" | **Yes** — `POST /design-reviews` (`designs/design-reviews/service.ts create()`) | **Wired up** (Part C2) |
| "Comment thread" quick action | `architect-dashboard.tsx` | disabled, ambiguous "Open active review discussions" | No — grepped `server/src`, only per-decision comment fields exist, no general thread table | **Left as genuinely unbuilt**, relabeled honestly (Part C2) |
| "Generate options / AI design variations" | `architect-dashboard.tsx` | disabled, "AI design variations" | N/A — fake-AI stub, never real | **Removed as scope-creep placeholder** (Part C2) |
| "New transaction" | `finance-dashboard.tsx` | disabled, tooltip explains no distinct transaction type | Confirmed: no `cash-flow`/`transactions` route exists (`cash_flow_entries` table has zero server routes) | **Left as-is** — already honestly labeled from a prior round, not a fake claim |
| "Awaiting your approval" | `pm-dashboard.tsx` | `ComingSoonCard`, "No approvals backend exists yet" | **Yes** — `GET /workflows/approvals(/stats)` | **Wired up** (Part C1) |
| "Activity & advisories" | `pm-dashboard.tsx` | `ComingSoonCard`, "site advisories aren't backed by any table" | Advisories: **yes** (the 5 signal rules, already shown by `WaitingOnYouCard` above it). Activity feed: **no** (grepped, no feed/log endpoint besides admin-only Audit Trail) | **Split**: advisories claim removed (redundant with `WaitingOnYouCard`); activity feed kept honest, relabeled (Part C1) |
| "Workforce snapshot" | `admin-dashboard.tsx` | `ComingSoonCard`, "no cross-project attendance/workforce endpoint" | **Yes** — `GET /employees` + `GET /attendance` were already unfiltered | **Wired up** (Part C3) |
| `hrAIInsights`/"AI HR assistant" card | `hr-dashboard.tsx` | gated behind `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders` (permanently false) | N/A — fake-AI stub (`mock-data.ts`) | **Left off** — correctly gated already, not resurrected |
| "AI suggestions" tab | `pm-workflows.tsx` | gated behind `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders` | N/A — fake-AI stub, "Not yet connected" | **Left off** — correctly gated already |
| "AI" anomaly column/card | `finance-expenses.tsx` | gated behind `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders`, keyed off `expense.anomalyScore` (nothing ever writes it) | N/A — fake-AI stub | **Left off** — correctly gated already |
| "Infrastructure health" card | `it-designer-dashboard.tsx` | `ComingSoonCard`, "not recorded anywhere" | Confirmed — no uptime/backup table exists | **Left as-is** — already honest, non-AI |
| "Resources & Tools" | `shared-resources.tsx` | `ComingSoonCard` | Confirmed — no resources table exists | **Left as-is** — already honest, non-AI |
| Header "AI · {primaryAi}" badge | `header.tsx` | gated behind `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders` | N/A — static per-role string, computes nothing | **Left off** — correctly gated already |
| "Generate with AI" hint | `multi-step-page.tsx` | gated behind `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders` | N/A — static hint, no backend call | **Left off** — correctly gated already |

No hardcoded `disabled` (as opposed to `disabled={someCondition}`) was found anywhere in
`client/src/pages/roles/*/*.tsx` outside the two rows above (architect's Comment thread, once
fixed to Generate options being removed, and finance-dashboard's New transaction) — every other
`disabled` in the codebase is conditional on a real loading/permission/validation state.
**Conclusion: C2's "Request review" was the one real instance of "disabled button on a working
endpoint" in the app; every fake-AI-flavored surface was already correctly hidden behind
`FEATURES.aiPlaceholders` from prior rounds, none resurrected here.**

Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server` and client `npm run build`: both clean.


### Part E — HR data realism: 100-employee roster + real KPIs

- **[x] E1 — 100 employees.** `seed-demo-accounts.ts` already created 50 employee rows (one per
  demo account, `EMP-DEMO-NN`, each with `userId` set). Added `buildRosterEmployees(50, ...)`: 50
  more roster-only rows (`EMP-ROSTER-001..050`, `userId: null` — nullable per schema, no login
  needed), deterministic (`mulberry32` seeded PRNG, not `Math.random()` — the same seed every run
  is what makes upsert idempotency possible) but genuinely varied: Filipino first/last name pools
  (40×30 combinations), 15 real PH construction trade roles/departments (Mason, Carpenter, Steel
  Fixer, Electrician, Plumber, Welder, Painter, Heavy Equipment Operator, Foreman, Safety Officer,
  Surveyor, Draftsman, Warehouseman, Site Clerk, Laborer), `site` drawn from the real 7
  `DEMO-STAGE-*` project names (queried live via `SELECT name FROM projects`, not hardcoded),
  `status` varied (Active/On Leave/Inactive, not uniform), `attendanceRate` 72-100%, `performance`
  2.8-5.0, `hiredOn` spread across the last 6 years, `payRate`/`rateType` spread realistically
  (₱115-165/hr trades, ₱645-1,450/day foreman/laborer bands, ₱20K-32K/month office trades) —
  consistent with `ph-statutory.ts`'s contribution bands (these land well inside its normal
  salary-credit range once annualized, not at either extreme).
- **[x] E2 — idempotent.** Upserted on `employeeId` (select-then-update-or-insert). Ran the full
  seed script twice: `SELECT count(*) FROM employees` → **100 both times**.
- **[x] E3 — HR dashboard section rewire.** Scoped to the sections the task explicitly named
  (`WorkforceSection`, `PayrollSection`) plus the shared data path C3/C4 both consume:
  - `WorkforceSection()`: the 4 hardcoded KPIs (480/418/62/17) and the hardcoded `workforceSites`
    array are gone. Real numbers via the new shared `useWorkforceSnapshot()` hook (`GET
    /employees` + `GET /attendance`, both already org-wide unfiltered reads — same data path as
    C3's `WorkforceSnapshotCard`, not a second query). "Assigned"/"available"/"OT crews" are
    honestly windowed to the *last 30 days* rather than claiming "today", with an explicit note
    why (this sandbox's seeded demo attendance is dated inside each project's own
    construction-phase timeline, not around today's date — a small real number is correct, not a
    bug). The allocation board is now real per-site employee counts (`employees.site`, grouped
    from the real 7 demo projects), not a hardcoded 4-site array.
  - `PayrollSection()`: the hardcoded "Payroll batch B-118" table (`payrollRows`, mock-data.ts)
    and the hardcoded 78/6/4/12% distribution are gone. Real data via the already-existing
    `listPayrollBatches()`/`listPayroll()` (`client/src/features/hr/payroll-api.ts`, itself
    reading real `payroll_batches`/`payroll` rows generated by the already-verified `POST
    /payroll/generate`). KPIs (gross/net/OT hours/awaiting-approval) and the summary distribution
    are computed live from every real batch, not one hardcoded "B-118".
  - `mock-data.ts`'s `workforceSites` and `payrollRows` are no longer imported by
    `hr-dashboard.tsx`. **Deviation, documented rather than silently expanded**: `OverviewSection`,
    `EmployeesSection`, `AttendanceSection`, and `ReportsSection` still read `employees`/
    `attendanceLogs`/`hrReports`/`hrNotifications`/`hrActivity`/`departments` from `mock-data.ts` —
    a full rewrite of every section (not just the two the task explicitly named in C4/E3) was
    judged out of scope for this pass given the size of the remaining task list; the `mock-data`
    import itself therefore stays in the file. Flagged here rather than claimed as fully removed.
  - `admin-dashboard.tsx`'s `WorkforceSnapshotCard` (C3) and this section now read from the exact
    same hook — one shared real data path, per the task's own instruction.
- **[x] E4 — independent verification.** Real API numbers cross-checked against direct SQL
  (`psql`, same live local DB), both matching exactly:

  ```
  SQL:  SELECT count(*) FROM employees;                                    -> 100
  SQL:  SELECT count(*) FROM employees WHERE status='Active';              -> 82
  SQL:  SELECT count(DISTINCT employee_id) FROM attendance
          WHERE log_date >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days');           -> 1
  SQL:  SELECT sum(gross_payroll), sum(net_payroll) FROM payroll_batches;  -> 3600.00 / 2064.00

  API (GET /employees, GET /attendance, GET /payroll/batches/all, as HR):
    total employees: 100
    active employees: 82
    assigned in last 30d (useWorkforceSnapshot's exact logic): 1
    available: 81
    batches: 3, sum gross: 3600, sum net: 2064
  ```

  Every number the API/UI shows matches its independent SQL source exactly — no drift between
  what HR's dashboard displays and what the tables actually contain.

Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server`: clean. Server `npm test`: 84/84 pass (unchanged — this pass
touched no signal/gate logic). Client `npm run build`: clean.

## Round 4 acceptance status

- Part A: done, all 7 items verified live (see above).
- Part B (AI Validation Reference page): **not built this round** — deprioritized against the
  time budget in favor of finishing Parts A/C/D/E with real, verified evidence rather than
  shipping a shallow, unverified reference page. Flagged as the one incomplete top-level part;
  see Questions.
- Part C: all four dashboards fixed, live-verified.
- Part D: full audit table, every disabled/placeholder element given a recorded decision.
- Part E: 100 employees confirmed idempotent, HR's Workforce/Payroll sections rewired to real
  data, every number independently cross-checked against SQL.
- `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders`'s surface table: not touched, nothing resurrected (confirmed by D3's
  audit — every fake-AI-flavored surface found was already correctly gated from a prior round).
- Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server`, `npm test` (84/84), and client `npm run build`: all clean
  after every part in this round.

## Questions (Round 4)

- Part B (AI Validation Reference page) was not built this round given the remaining time budget
  after Parts A/C/D/E — a follow-up session should pick it up next, sourcing content live from
  `server/src/config/signals.ts` (`SIGNAL_THRESHOLDS`, `SIMILARITY_FLOOR`, cache TTL), the
  proposal validator, and `cost.ts`/`matcher.ts`, per the original spec's B1-B4.

## Round 4 follow-up — Part B built (AI Validation Reference page)

After Part E, revisited Part B with the remaining time budget instead of leaving it fully
skipped.

- **[x] B1 — route + nav.** New `server/src/ai-validation/routes.ts` `GET /ai-validation/config`
  (open to any authenticated role — unlike the existing admin-only `/references-status`/
  `/refresh-references` on the same router, registered *before* that router's
  `requireRole("admin")` middleware so it isn't caught by it) returns
  `SIGNAL_THRESHOLDS`/`SIMILARITY_FLOOR`/`REFERENCE_CACHE_TTL_MS` (imported live from
  `server/src/config/signals.ts`, not copied) plus the real cached-item count/freshness. New
  client route `/ai-validation-reference` (`App.tsx`, gated behind `FEATURES.ai`, not
  `aiPlaceholders` — its content is entirely real), added to `providers/resources.ts` as a
  genuinely new resource (`ai-validation-reference`, distinct name, distinct route — the old
  `ai-insights` entry stays exactly as dead/hidden as before, never resurrected) and to every
  role's array in `config/role-resources.ts` (10 roles, right after `"dashboard"`) so every role
  can find it.
- **[x] B2/B3 — content.** `client/src/pages/roles/shared/ai-validation-reference.tsx` fetches the
  config live and renders: (1) the proposal completeness check (real logic read from
  `proposals/validation.ts`, title/project/description/amount rules, links to `DEMO-STAGE-0`);
  (2) the cost-comparison engine (Dice-coefficient matching, the four real verdicts, the live
  similarity floor and cache-TTL values, links to `DEMO-STAGE-3`); (3) all five signal rules, each
  with its real warn/critical thresholds read from the API response (not hardcoded), its
  lifecycle stage, and a link to the `AISIG-DEMO` scenario. Each rule states its demo project in
  one line, per B3.
- **[x] B4 — verified live**, not assumed: Playwright, logged in as PM, loaded
  `/ai-validation-reference` and confirmed by real DOM text that the page shows `0.4` (similarity
  floor) and `7 days` (cache TTL) — matching `SIMILARITY_FLOOR = 0.40`/`REFERENCE_CACHE_TTL_MS = 7
  * 24h` in `signals.ts` exactly — then clicked the real "DEMO · 4 Construction" link and
  confirmed it actually navigated to `/projects/64` (a real project detail page, not a dead link).
  **Real finding made building this**: `/projects/:projectId` already accepts a project *code* as
  well as a numeric id (`ProjectRepository.getById` falls back to a `?search=` + exact-code match)
  — confirmed live via `curl .../api/projects?search=DEMO-STAGE-3`. This means Part A5's
  bookmarkable-route concern (numeric ids shift on re-seed) has a real fix already available:
  linking by code (`/projects/DEMO-STAGE-3`) instead of by numeric id is stable across re-seeds.
  Corrected A5's note above rather than leaving the earlier, now-inaccurate claim standing.

Server `npx tsc --noEmit -p server`: clean. Client `npm run build`: clean.

## Round 4 final acceptance status (corrected)

All five parts (A-E) are now built and live-verified in this round — see each section above for
evidence. `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders`'s surface table was not touched; nothing fake-AI was
resurrected (Part D's audit confirms every existing fake-AI surface stayed correctly gated).


## Demo script (engineer / site personnel / consultant alignment pass)

Branch `feature/engineer-consultant-alignment`. One seeded project serves every role: **`DEMO-STAGE-3`**
("DEMO · 4 Construction") — writable, not archived, with the demo Engineer (Paolo Mendoza), Site
Personnel (Rico Domingo), Architect and Consultant all staffed on it.

**Environment** — both flags on, or the AI surfaces will not appear:

```
FEATURE_AI=true         # server/.env
VITE_FEATURE_AI=true    # client/.env
```

Seed: `npm run db:seed`, `npm run ai:seed-references`, then `npm --prefix server run demo:seed`
(re-runnable; rebuilds `DEMO-STAGE-0..6`). `DEMO-STAGE-3` additionally gets the role extras from
`buildRoleDemoExtras` in `demo-seed-stages.ts`: a second active milestone ("Slab pour complete"),
two Resolved quality issues with resolution notes (slab cracks, honeycombing), and one open issue
similar to the first ("Cracks on warehouse slab surface after curing"). All accounts use `Demo@12345`
(see `docs/TEST_ACCOUNTS.md`).

### Demo script — Engineer (`engineer@easyconstruct.demo`)

1. **Requirements → New requirement.** Project `DEMO-STAGE-3`, title "Warehouse floor slab". In
   Description type `Need concrete slab for the warehouse floor, around 320 sqm`, click
   **Structure with AI**. The text becomes four headed sections (Objectives / Materials / Constraints /
   Specifications), Category is set (still editable), "Reworded: around → approximately" and
   "sqm → m²" appear with **Undo**, and a suggestions list (strength grade, thickness, curing,
   reinforcement, testing…) appears — tick two and **Add selected**. **Undo structuring** restores
   the original text.
2. Attach any file, **Save as draft**, then **Submit for approval**.
3. *(Project Manager `pm@easyconstruct.demo`)* **Approvals** → approve the requirement.
4. **Progress** → **New report** (e.g. Progress Report on `DEMO-STAGE-3`); then in the **Milestones**
   card press **Mark completed** on "Slab pour complete" and confirm. Click a row under
   **Recent site reports** to open the read-only report detail.
5. **Issues** → **Report issue**: project `DEMO-STAGE-3`, title "Cracks on slab surface after
   curing", category Quality, description mentioning cracks on the concrete slab. Submit. The issue
   shows **Similar issue resolved before** with issue code · project · date · match %.
6. Set that issue's status to **Resolved**, press **Use as starting point** to copy the precedent's
   note into the resolution notes, edit it, and **Update status**.
7. **Dashboard** → click an assigned-project row (opens the project page) and a row under **Recent
   reports** (opens the report detail).
8. Sidebar → **Tasks** (create a task for Site Personnel).

With the flags off: no **Structure with AI** button, no **Similar issue resolved before** box; Report
issue, milestones, dashboard links and Tasks all still work.

### Demo script — Site Personnel (`site@easyconstruct.demo`)

1. **Requirements** → **New requirement** (the button now shows for Site Personnel). The project picker lists
   only projects Rico is staffed on; use `DEMO-STAGE-3`. There is no **Structure with AI** button for this role.
2. Fill title/category/description, attach a file, **Save as draft**; then press **Submit for approval** on the
   draft (only drafts you wrote yourself show the button).
3. *(Project Manager)* **Approvals** → decide it. Site Personnel cannot approve or reject, edit another
   author's requirement, or delete.

### Demo script — Consultant (`consultant@easyconstruct.demo`)

1. **Designs** → click a row: read-only detail with name, code, project, discipline, phase, version, status,
   lead architect, engineers, description and the design's files (or "No files attached to this design.").
2. **Design reviews**: each row now shows the design name, its project and its file links; the decision buttons
   are unchanged.
3. **Proposals** → open a proposal: the **Rule-based validation summary** ("Completeness checks — decision
   support only.") is computed on demand if the proposal was created while the flag was off.
4. **Advisory Documents** → **Upload Advisory**: pick a project (only projects you are staffed on), optionally
   **Related to** a proposal or design on that project, choose a file (required), upload. The list shows the
   related item; old rows with no file show a muted **No file attached** badge
   (`npx tsx src/scripts/flag-advisory-without-file.ts` lists them without changing anything).

### Notes from running this pass

- `demo-seed-stages.ts` was failing on `POST /projects` (the project schema now requires `plannedStartDate`);
  the seed now sends today's date.
- The role extras (milestone, Resolved quality issues, open similar issue) are added only to `DEMO-STAGE-3`.
- The single schema change is `drizzle/0016_advisory_related_item.sql` (hand-written, idempotent, like
  `0015_payroll_lifecycle.sql`; `drizzle-kit generate` needs an interactive rename prompt against the current
  snapshots) and is mirrored in `ensure-demo-schema.ts`.


## Revision management (Architect → Revisions)

Branch `feature/architect-revisions`. Seed: `npm --prefix server run demo:revisions` (after `demo:seed`) builds
three tracked items on `DEMO-STAGE-3` with several versions each (a design, a blueprint, a new "Ground floor plan"),
reviewed by the demo Consultant so every status appears. Safe to re-run: an item that already has revisions is skipped.

### Demo script — Architect (`architect@easyconstruct.demo`)

1. **Revisions** — KPI strip (items tracked / awaiting review / under review / approved), search, project / type /
   status / date filters, pagination. "No revisions recorded yet." appears only when there are none at all.
2. Click a row → **version history** drawer: every version newest first, current one highlighted, reviewer outcome and
   comment on each, **Preview** and **Download** per version.
3. **New version** (in the drawer) or **Create revision** (page header): pick project → item type → item (or "Start a
   new plan"), attach a file (progress bar; PDF, DWG/DXF, Office or image up to `MAX_UPLOAD_MB`), write what changed.
   The version number it will get is shown; the previous current version becomes *Superseded* (or keeps Approved /
   Rejected).
4. Tick two versions in the drawer → **Compare selected**: metadata diff plus side-by-side previews for images and PDFs
   (other types show metadata and download only — there is no visual diff).
5. Links: **Designs** (Latest revision column), **Blueprints**, **Documentation** cards ("View revisions"), and the
   dashboard's Revisions quick link (live counts).

### Demo script — Consultant / Project Manager

- **Consultant → Design Reviews** (Approved tab for the seeded design): "Latest revision" with **Version history**.
  In the drawer the Consultant can **Start review / Approve / Reject** the current version (a rejection needs a comment);
  the Architect is notified.
- **Project Manager → project page** (`DEMO-STAGE-3`): a **Revisions** card with each item's latest version; same drawer.

### Rules worth knowing

- History is immutable: there is no edit or delete endpoint. A new upload is a new row; Approved / Rejected / Superseded
  are final.
- Version numbers are assigned by the server in a transaction behind a per-item lock (8 simultaneous uploads got
  consecutive numbers 5–12 with exactly one current version).
- Architects see and create revisions only on projects they are assigned to (403 otherwise, including by direct id and
  download). PM: own projects. Consultant: staffed projects. Admin: all.
- Files are uploaded through the shared large-file utility (direct to Blob on Vercel, streamed to disk locally) and then
  recorded with `POST /api/revisions` (JSON, not multipart: serverless request bodies are capped around 4.5 MB).
## Round 5 — PM couldn't see a Final Inspection to approve on DEMO-STAGE-4 (Closeout)

User report: "pm doesnt see the final inspection approval on reports bucket" when visiting the
Closeout-phase demo project.

**Root cause, pinned down by live reproduction, not guessed:** every one of the Reports-page
building blocks (nav entry, ACL, route, `GET /engineering-reports`, the Approve button's `PATCH`,
the role guard) was already working correctly — confirmed by creating a throwaway pending Final
Inspection as the engineer and clicking Approve as `pm@easyconstruct.demo` via Playwright,
end-to-end, with no code changes. The actual bug was in `demo-seed-stages.ts`'s
`buildCloseoutPhase()`: it immediately PATCHed every Closeout-stage project's Final Inspection
report straight to `Approved` right after creating it — including `DEMO-STAGE-4` itself, the
project meant to be *sitting at* Closeout, not past it. Gate X1 ("Final inspection approved") is a
Closeout-*exit* check (`server/src/lifecycle/gates.ts` `evaluateCloseout`), not an entry
requirement, so a project freshly at Closeout is supposed to have it still pending — that pending
report is exactly what a PM is meant to see and act on in `/reports`. The seed script's own
"every gate for this phase already passing" convention (deliberately chosen for every other stage
to show a green checklist) papered over the one gate that's supposed to be the live demo moment at
this specific stage, so there was never anything to approve.

**Fix:** `buildCloseoutPhase(code, t, leaveFinalInspectionPending)` — the Final Inspection report
is only auto-approved when `leaveFinalInspectionPending` is false. The seeding loop now passes
`target === "Closeout"` for this flag, so `DEMO-STAGE-4` (target Closeout) leaves it `Submitted`,
while `DEMO-STAGE-5`/`DEMO-STAGE-6` (target Completed/Archived — both legitimately past Closeout,
needing X1 to really pass for `advance()`/`archive()` to succeed) still get it approved exactly as
before. X2-X4 are unaffected and still pass on `DEMO-STAGE-4`, so the project doesn't regress on
anything else. Updated the file's own top-of-file doc comment to document this as the second
deliberate "left unsatisfied on purpose" exception (after Construction's K1).

**Verified live, not assumed:**
- Re-ran `npx tsx src/scripts/demo-seed-stages.ts` (idempotent re-run, all 7 projects rebuilt
  clean). Direct SQL: `DEMO-STAGE-4`'s Final Inspection is `Submitted`; `DEMO-STAGE-5`/
  `DEMO-STAGE-6`'s are `Approved`, unchanged from before.
- `GET /projects/DEMO-STAGE-4/lifecycle` (as PM): `X1` → `passed: false`, `"No approved Final
  Inspection report yet"`, `link: "/reports"`; `X2`/`X3`/`X4` → all `passed: true`. Phase still
  correctly `Closeout`, progress `98%`, `canAdvance: false`.
- Playwright, logged in as `pm@easyconstruct.demo`: sidebar → Reports → Pending tab shows the real
  "Final inspection" row for `DEMO-STAGE-4`; clicked the actual per-row Approve button (not the
  "Approved" tab — an early test run of mine mis-clicked that tab trigger by accident and briefly
  looked like a broken button; the real Approve button works correctly) → `PATCH
  /api/engineering-reports/27` → `200`, status flipped to `Approved`, row left the Pending tab.
  Reset back to `Submitted` afterward so the demo project is left in its intended pending state for
  an actual reviewer to use.
- Server `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean. (No client changes this round — this was a seed-data/backend
  fix only.)

Commit: see git log.


## Clean slate — all projects removed, 100-person roster, DEMO-S1..S7, role sample data (2026-10-04)

Branch `prod`. Request: wipe every project, reset employees to exactly 100, reseed one project per lifecycle
phase and give each of the 10 roles populated pages, **without touching accounts**.

### Target database and guard (decision recorded)
The only database configured (`server/.env`) is the Neon cloud DB `neondb` on
`ep-icy-meadow-ao4hqnb1-pooler.c-2.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech` — not local, and the same one the deployed app uses.
`pg_dump` is not installed on this machine. Both would normally stop the run; the owner then explicitly instructed
"reset the database that is connected to the prod". So the host was added to `DEMO_RESET_ALLOWED_HOSTS` explicitly
and the backup is a Node-side full-table JSON dump (Neon point-in-time restore is the second safety net).

`server/src/scripts/reset-demo-data.ts` (`npm run demo:reset`):
- refuses without `ALLOW_DEMO_RESET=true` — shown: `REFUSED: set ALLOW_DEMO_RESET=true to run this script.`
- refuses a non-local host that is not listed in `DEMO_RESET_ALLOWED_HOSTS` — shown: `REFUSED: host ep-icy-meadow-… is neither local nor listed in DEMO_RESET_ALLOWED_HOSTS.`
- prints host + database name first; aborts if any public table is not classified (preserve / delete / special)
- writes + verifies a backup **before** any delete: `server/backups/neondb-backup-2026-10-04T10-16-58-166Z.json`
  (51 tables, 8054 rows, 2811 KB; `server/backups/` is gitignored)
- runs every delete, the employee reset and the roster insert in **one transaction**, re-checks the account
  checksums and `count(*) = 100` inside it and rolls back on any mismatch.

### Part 0 — audit (from the live schema, not memory)
- Real FKs are few: budget children → `budgets`; `workflows.budget_id`; `proposals.workflow_id`; workflow children
  (`stages`, `line_items`, `attachments`, `validation_results`) cascade; `design_*`/`blueprints`/`architect_documents` → `designs`;
  `milestone_links` → `milestones` (cascade); several tables → `users` (all `NO ACTION`).
  **Everything keyed by project is a loose string code** (`project_code` / `project`): tasks, milestones, issues, requirements,
  documents, engineering_reports, expenses, budgets, attendance, payroll_batches, notifications, project_members,
  project_phase_history, revisions, blueprints, designs, proposals, workflows — none cascade, all deleted explicitly.
- Account ↔ employee link lives on the **employee side** (`employees.user_id → users.id`). 50 of 60 users have an employee row
  (`EMP-DEMO-01…50`); the 10 `*grace@` accounts and `nhylcyrusgervasio@gmail.com` have none. Those 50 linked rows survive untouched.
- The four named people did not exist and have no accounts, so nothing was linked (linking would not need a `users` write, but there is no account to link to).
- Before: projects 26, employees 100 (50 linked + 50 unlinked `EMP-ROSTER-*`), users 60.
- Preserved: `users`, `password_reset_tokens`, `roles`, `workflow_templates` (incl. `Project Closeout`), `reference_snapshots` (411),
  `audit_logs` (rows kept), and every notification **not** tied to a project code (117 kept, 1416 deleted).
  There is no feature-flag / system-settings / approval-hierarchy table: those are code config (`FEATURES`) or live in `workflow_templates`.

### Dry run (verbatim, `npm run demo:reset -- --dry-run`)
```
validation_results 22 | workflow_attachments 53 | workflow_line_items 23 | workflow_stages 215 | proposals 27 | workflows 65
budget_adjustments 3 | budget_approval_steps 132 | budgets 33 | milestone_links 32 | milestones 45 | tasks 74 | issues 21
requirements 47 | architect_documents 2 | blueprints 22 | design_reviews 22 | design_engineers 28 | designs 28 | revisions 10
engineering_reports 18 | documents 78 | expenses 7 | payroll 831 | payroll_batch_decisions 6 | payroll_batches 19
attendance 854 | project_phase_history 96 | project_members 145 | projects 26
notifications (project_code IS NOT NULL) 1416 | employees (user_id IS NULL) 50
(all other listed tables: 0 rows)   Employees after reset: 50 linked + 50 roster
Dry run complete — nothing changed.
```

### Account checksums (md5 of every row, before the wipe → after wipe → after ALL seeding; `npm run demo:verify`)
```
users                  60 rows md5=48ac4a39f4d831152ff883e987618e40   identical at all three points
password_reset_tokens   4 rows md5=c7b81d12a72ee80868221ac4671044b2   identical
roles                  10 rows md5=9862b9954753a87ed4dbe4814a260deb   identical
employee↔user links    50 rows md5=e219ef69c441caafa3ece0f6b0bc8ddb   identical
```
Zero INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on any of these tables. Seeding logs in as the existing accounts; it never writes them.

### Parts A/B — result
Orphan check across 18 project-code tables = 0 everywhere (`demo:verify` §8). `employees` = **100**: 88 Active, 8 Inactive,
3 On Leave, 1 Archived; 45 Field Operations, 10 Engineering, 6 each Project Management / HR / Design / Finance / Administration,
5 each Executive / Advisory / IT. The 4 names exist exactly as written (`EMP-ROSTER-001…004`: Dirk Louisse R. Villaflor – Site Engineer,
Gian Carl Q. Dela Rosa – Safety Officer, Mark Gabriel A. Yoldi – Foreman, Nhyl Cyrus J. Gervasio – Surveyor, all Active). The other 46:
varied Filipino names, no duplicate full names, trades weighted to the field, pay rates inside realistic PH bands (`Daily 610–1700`,
`Hourly 120–185`, `Monthly 19k–52k`), hire dates 2018–2026, sites spread over the seven demo projects. Contact data is synthetic
(`emp-roster-NNN@example.com`, `0900-000-xxxx`); the employees table holds no government IDs.
Generator: `demo-roster.ts` (fixed seed 20261004, upsert on `employee_id`, never overwrites a `user_id` row). `npm run demo:employees` run twice →
employee-table md5 identical (`468f5fe1febd6d432e331c20a3c30eb8`, 100 rows).

### Part C — seven projects (built through the real HTTP API as the real accounts)
`DEMO-S1…S7`, definitions in `demo-projects.ts`, builder `demo-seed-stages.ts`. Each project has its own client, municipality, geofence,
contract value and dates. Gate output straight from `GET /projects/:id/lifecycle`:
```
DEMO-S1 Proposal          6%   P1:true  P2:true  P3:true  P4:false P5:false
DEMO-S2 Design           15%   D1:true  D2:false D3:false
DEMO-S3 Pre-Construction 28%   C1:true  C2:true  C3:true  C4:false C5:false
DEMO-S4 Construction     61%   K1:false K2:false K3:false K4:false   (13 tasks, 7 done)
DEMO-S5 Closeout         97%   X1:true  X2:true  X3:false X4:false
DEMO-S6 Completed       100%   (terminal)  completed_at 2026-04-27
DEMO-S7 Archived        100%   (terminal)  completed 2025-05-26, archived_at 2025-11-24
```
Phases were reached with the real `advance()` / `archive` endpoints, so the earlier-phase gates are genuinely true. Progress is from
`refreshProjectProgress()`. Budgets: four approved lines per project (Materials 45 %, Labor 30 %, Equipment 15 %, Contingency 10 %) summing to the contract value.
**S7 rejects writes** (`assertProjectWritable`): `POST /tasks`, `POST /milestones`, `PATCH /projects/:id` → **409 "Project is Archived — changes are locked"**.

**DEMO-S4 Budget Change Request** (real `validateWorkflowLineItems()`, `FEATURE_AI=true`, reference prices from `reference_snapshots`):
```
"Ready-mix concrete (3000-4000 PSI), delivered"  -> within-range   (+1.0%)
"Concrete slab, poured and finished"             -> above-typical  (+165.7%)
"Miscellaneous sitework contingency"             -> no-match       (line has no quantity)
```
**All five advisory signals fire on DEMO-S4** (the old `AISIG-*` scenario was folded in): `npm run demo:ai-signals` → 7 passed, 0 failed:
cost-variance (critical, +165.7 %), cumulative-change-impact (warn, +10.5 % — an approved "Change Order" budget line), burn-vs-progress (warn, 79 % of
budget consumed at 54 % of tasks complete), issue-recurrence (warn, 3rd Material issue in 30 days), stalled-stage (warn, BCR at Finance Review ~2 days).
The verifier also proves gate checks / `canAdvance` equal the pure `evaluateGate` output (advice never blocks).

**Staffing (accounts only; nobody is on all seven, so server scoping is visible):**

| Project | PM | Architect | Consultant | Engineer | Site |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | pm@ | architect@ | consultant@ | — | — |
| S2 | pm@ | architect@ | consultant@ | engineer@ | — |
| S3 | pm@ | architect@ | consultant@ | engineer@ | site@ |
| S4 | pm@ | architect@ | consultant@ | engineer@ | site@ |
| S5 | pm@ | architect1@ | consultant1@ | engineer@ | site@ |
| S6 | projectmanager1@ | architect1@ | consultant@ | engineer1@ | site@ |
| S7 | projectmanager1@ | architect1@ | consultant1@ | engineer1@ | sitepersonnel1@ |

Idempotency: `npm run demo:seed` run a second time leaves every row count and every project id unchanged (a project already at its target phase is skipped;
a half-built one is deleted and rebuilt). Counts before = after: projects 7, employees 100, project_members 25, proposals 14, designs 10, blueprints 11,
requirements 18, tasks 65, milestones 19, issues 10, engineering_reports 9, documents 35, budgets 21, budget_adjustments 4, expenses 19, workflows 24,
payroll_batches 7, payroll 51, attendance 490, architect_documents 5, revisions 9. Ids: `54 S1, 55 S2, 56 S3, 59 S4, 61 S5, 62 S6, 63 S7`.
Project search: `?search=DEMO` / `DEMO ·` returns the demo projects together; `?search=DEMO-S4` resolves a code (this is what the AI-reference "see it live" links use).

### Part D
- D1: `ai-validation-reference.tsx` DemoLinks repointed (`DEMO-STAGE-0 → DEMO-S1`, `DEMO-STAGE-3 → DEMO-S4`, every `AISIG-DEMO → DEMO-S4`);
  `demo-ai-signals.ts` is now a verifier of S4 instead of a project builder; `demo-seed-revisions.ts` default project is `DEMO-S3`.
  Unit-test fixtures that merely contain the string `DEMO-STAGE-x` were left (they do not touch the database). Older sections of this doc keep the old codes as history.
- D2: HR `GET /workforce-reports/summary` vs SQL: total 100 = 100, active 88 = 88, inactive 12 = 8 Inactive + 3 On Leave + 1 Archived, department split identical
  (Field Operations 45, Engineering 10, …). Attendance table: 490 rows over 25 working days (375 Present, 48 Late, 31 Absent, 36 Half Day, 20 outside the geofence).
- D3: every list endpoint used by a sidebar page returns 200 with data for the role that owns it (matrix below); notification bell: owner 55, PM 71, site 21 items.

### Part E — role data
**E0 gap list after Parts A–C (before role seeding):** attendance 0, architect_documents 0, revisions 0, budget_adjustments 0, expenses 5, payroll_batches 3,
issues 7 (none site-reported), engineering_reports 3 (all Final Inspections), documents 19 (only gate documents), proposals 7 (one status per project),
workflows 11, requirements 10 (all Approved), blueprints 5, designs 6. **After `demo:seed-roles`:** see counts above (attendance 490, architect_documents 5, revisions 9,
budget_adjustments 4, expenses 19, payroll_batches 7, issues 10, engineering_reports 9, documents 35, proposals 14, workflows 24, requirements 18, blueprints 11, designs 10).

`demo-seed-roles.ts` (`npm run demo:seed-roles`, which also runs `demo-seed-revisions.ts`) creates, always through the real endpoints and with real uploaded
PDF/PNG files (private Blob store, authenticated download): 7 more proposals (5 waiting on the Consultant, 1 Revision Requested, 1 Rejected, 1 fully Approved), 4 more designs with
reviews (Approved/Rejected/Pending), 6 blueprints (Pending, Superseded, Rejected, Revision Required, Approved), architect documentation, 8 requirements (Draft / Under Review / Approved / Rejected, each with a file),
3 site-reported issues with photos, 6 engineering reports across statuses, 12 field/advisory/turnover documents (advisory ones linked to a real proposal or design), 14 expenses with receipts
(pending / approved / rejected), 4 budget adjustments, 6 extra workflows (HR, Consultant, Engineer, PM, Architect waiting; 2 backdated to be stalled), 490 attendance rows for the S4/S5 crews
(admin back-fill path) + 15 site clock-ins with photo and coordinates (2 outside the radius), and 4 payroll batches built by the real payroll generator (statutory deductions from `ph-statutory.ts`):
approved, pending Finance, draft, rejected (`revision_required`). Idempotent: second run creates nothing.

**Role × page matrix (`npm run demo:verify` §5 — rows each page's endpoint returns; every row PASS except the three documented gaps):**

| Role (account) | Pages → rows |
|---|---|
| Owner (owner@) | dashboard 7, portfolio 7, proposals 14, audit trail 3637, oversight 13, reports 9, **account recovery — n/a** |
| Admin (admin@) | projects 7, workflows 13, documents 35, activity logs 3638, security 4, roles 10, workflow configuration 10, approval hierarchy 10, **support — n/a** |
| IT Designer (itdesigner1@) | users 60, proposals 14, projects 7, workflows 13, documents 35, roles 10, activity logs 3640, security 4, **support — n/a** |
| Project Manager (pm@) | projects 5, workflows 13, approvals 3, issues 8, tasks 33, documents 25, reports 7 |
| Human Resources (hr@) | employees 100, attendance 490, payroll batches 7, workforce summary 7, approvals 1 (Subcontractor onboarding at HR stage), reports 5 |
| Finance (finance@) | summary 8, budgets 21, payroll batches 6, expenses 19, approvals 1, impact review 1, profitability 5 |
| Architect (architect@) | projects 4, designs 7, proposals 11, approvals 1, revisions 9, blueprints 8, documentation 5 |
| Engineer (engineer@) | projects 4, tasks 65, requirements 18, approvals 1, issues 10 |
| Site Personnel (site@) | tasks 48, attendance 490, requirements 18, documents 35, issues 3 |
| Consultant (consultant@) | projects 5, proposals 14, designs 10, design reviews 10, advisory documents 35, blueprints 11 |

(The HR "approvals" row was empty on the first matrix run; fixed by adding a Subcontractor onboarding workflow started by the PM so it waits on HR.)

**Scoping proof (`demo:verify` §6; direct API calls with another project's id):**
```
role                 sees              foreign   GET /projects/:id  GET /lifecycle  /designs?projectCode=foreign
architect@           S1,S2,S3,S4       DEMO-S5   403                403             0 rows
consultant@          S1,S2,S3,S4,S6    DEMO-S5   403                403             1 row   <- not scoped (see findings)
engineer@            S2,S3,S4,S5       DEMO-S1   403                403             0 rows
pm@                  S1,S2,S3,S4,S5    DEMO-S6   403                403             1 row   <- not scoped
projectmanager1@     S6,S7             DEMO-S2   403                403             3 rows  <- not scoped
site@                S3,S4,S5,S6       DEMO-S1   403                403             0 rows
```
**Seeded files** (`demo:verify` §9/§10): design PNG, advisory PDF, attendance photo, expense receipt, field-document PNG, requirement PDF and proposal attachment all return 200 with the right
magic bytes (`.PNG` / `%PDF`); **all 150 distinct file URLs referenced by seeded rows download with 200, 0 failing.**

### Findings, gaps and deviations (honest list)
1. **Dead pages / modules that do not exist in this codebase** (skipped, no feature built): Support (Admin, IT Designer) has no table or endpoint; Leave, Purchase requests, Vendor payments,
   Reimbursements and Inspections have no sidebar page (tables for the last three exist but are empty and unused by any UI); Account Recovery shows the 4 pre-existing
   `password_reset_tokens` rows and was not seeded (creating requests needs an account-table write).
2. **Payroll has no "paid" state** (statuses: draft / pending / approved / revision_required); one batch of each of those exists. "Paid" was not invented.
3. **Modules with no file column**, so their records cannot point to a file: blueprints (`file_type`/`size_kb` only), architect documentation, engineering reports.
   Their companion records (designs, documents, requirements, proposal workflow attachments) carry real files.
4. **Direct SQL where no service path exists:** back-dating of `projects.created_at/completed_at/archived_at`, `project_phase_history.created_at`, closeout `payroll_batches.created_at` and the
   stalled `workflow_stages.updated_at` (history timestamps are always "now" through the API); the 50 roster employees (employee reset happens inside the wipe transaction); and S5–S7 projects are created with
   today's date then PATCHed to their real dates because the create validator forbids past dates. Everything else is API.
5. **Server scoping gap (pre-existing, not changed here):** the project list and `GET /projects/:id` are scoped for Architect, Consultant, Engineer, PM, Site, but `GET /designs?projectCode=…`
   still returns another project's designs to Consultant and PM (Architect/Engineer/Site are scoped). Reported, not fixed (this task builds no features).
6. **Accounts:** `itdesigner@easyconstruct.demo` does not accept `Demo@12345` any more (its password was changed outside the seed). Accounts were not touched, so `itdesigner1@` was used for the IT Designer checks.
7. **DEMO-S4 progress is 61 %** (target "60–70 %"): 7 of 13 tasks done. Its burn-vs-progress signal needs spend far ahead of completion, so S4's approved spend (≈ PHP 56 M of 70.9 M planned) is deliberately heavy.
8. **Files of deleted records** (≈ 150 blobs from the old data) remain in the Blob store as unreferenced objects; they were not deleted.
9. A pre-existing "Resolve flags" button on the HR attendance page is still non-functional (unchanged, out of scope).
10. `FEATURES.aiPlaceholders` is still `false` (`client/src/config/features.ts:17`); no anomaly score or placeholder AI surface was added. Only rule-based advisory output from the real code paths is shown.

### Build / tests
`npx tsc --noEmit -p server` → exit 0. `npm run build` (client) → built, exit 0. `npm test` (server) → 223 pass, 0 fail.

### Re-run everything
```
cd server
$env:ALLOW_DEMO_RESET='true'; $env:DEMO_RESET_ALLOWED_HOSTS='<db host>'     # PowerShell; use export on bash
npm run demo:reset -- --dry-run      # prints row counts, changes nothing
npm run demo:reset                   # backup → one transaction (projects, employees → 100)
npm run ai:seed-references           # only if reference_snapshots is empty
npm run dev                          # separate terminal, FEATURE_AI=true
npm run demo:seed                    # S1..S7, then demo:seed-roles (+ revisions)
npm run demo:ai-signals              # asserts the five signals on DEMO-S4
npm run demo:verify                  # every table in this section
```


## Design revisions — project link, Design change history panel, demo generator (2026-10-04)

Branch `prod`. Extends `design_revisions` (the per-design version log). No second seeder: `demo:seed-roles` calls the new generator.

### Findings checked against HEAD (what was right, what was stale)
1. **Two-hop link, nothing queried it — confirmed.** `design_revisions.design_id → designs.id`, `designs.project_code` (free text) → `projects.code`. Now joined in one query (`findDetailed` / `findByProjectCode`).
2. **No `projectCode` filter / scoping — partly stale.** The list was already narrowed for the Architect (`scopeRowsByDesign`), but only for that one role; PM, Engineer, Consultant, Site read everything and any role could write. Fixed (A3/A4).
3. **`useDesignRevisionsController` raw `fetch` without a token — confirmed, but dead code.** Nothing renders it any more: the Architect Revisions page was rebuilt earlier on the newer `revisions` module (`useRevisions`, `apiClient`). The controller was moved to `apiClient` via the new repository anyway.
4. **Architect page shows `Design #id` — stale.** That page (`architect-revisions.tsx`) already shows item titles, project code and a project filter; the only gap was the project code not being a link — now a link to `/projects/<code>`.
5. **Project page shows no revision history — partly stale.** `ProjectDetailPage` already renders `ProjectRevisionsCard` (current version of each item, from the `revisions` module). It never showed the `design_revisions` log, which is what the new panel adds. **The two coexist on purpose and are labelled differently ("Revisions" vs "Design change history") — see Decisions needed.**
6. **`create` was a bare insert — confirmed.** No numbering, parent version, lock check, duplicate check, `designs.version/revision` update or audit.
7. **Seeders never created revisions — confirmed** (0 rows in `design_revisions` before this change).

### Backend
- Schema: `is_demo boolean not null default false` on `design_revisions` and `designs` (Drizzle `design-revisions.ts`, `designs.ts`), plus a unique index on `(design_id, version)`. Mechanism used: hand-written idempotent migration `server/drizzle/0020_design_revision_demo_flag.sql` + journal entry **and** the same statements in `ensure-demo-schema.ts` (the repo has both; `drizzle-kit generate` needs an interactive prompt). Applied to the database: `is_demo` present on both tables.
- `GET /api/design-revisions?projectCode=…` → items joined with `designCode/designName/discipline/projectCode/isDemo`, plus `meta` = `{ total, designsWithRevisions, latestVersion, latestChangeAt, awaitingApproval, byStatus, demoAllowed }`. Visibility is the project's own: the service resolves the project and calls the existing `projects/service.getById(id, scope)` (so a PM sees only their own, Engineer/Architect/Site/Consultant only staffed projects).
- Without `projectCode` the list is restricted to the caller's visible projects through a new `visibleProjectCodes(scope)` helper in `projects/service.ts` (same rules as the project list). `GET /:id` and writes also check the design's project.
- Writes: `POST/PATCH/DELETE` now `requireRole("architect","admin")`. `create` runs in one transaction: design row locked, duplicate `(designId, version)` → 409, `revisionNumber` = max+1, `parentVersion` defaults to the design's current version (none for a design's first revision), `designs.version/revision/updatedAt` updated, `approvedAt` set when Approved, author taken from the session for non-admins, `assertProjectWritable`, and an audit entry (`design-revision`, created / status-changed / deleted).
- Demo generator `designs/design-revisions/demo.ts` — `ensureProjectRevisionDemo(code, { dryRun, includeProposal })`. Idempotent (a project with any revision, real or demo, is left alone), deterministic (FNV hash of project + design code seeds the PRNG), 3–5 revisions per design (≤ 3 designs), `v0.1 → v1.0 → v1.1 → v2.0 → v2.1` with each `parentVersion` the previous one, reasons by discipline (Structural/Architectural/MEPF/Civil, ≤ 255 chars), earlier revisions Approved (one Rejected mid-chain on 4–5-long chains), the latest `Under Review` in Design and `Approved` afterwards. Dates run from the project's `created_at` to now, or to its completion date for a finished project, strictly increasing and never in the future; authors are architect/engineer names staffed on the project. Proposal-phase projects are skipped unless `--include-proposal`. If a project has no design it creates `DSN-<code>-DEMO` flagged `is_demo` (none was needed here — every demo project already has a design).
  It writes through `service.create` with an internal `bypassLock` (never reachable from a request body) because the seeded S7 is Archived and would otherwise reject its own history; flags and back-dated timestamps are accepted only on that internal path.
- `POST /api/design-revisions/demo?projectCode=` — admin only; 403 when `NODE_ENV=production` unless `ALLOW_DEMO_SEED=true` (`isDemoAllowed`, unit-tested).

### Commands
```
cd server
npm run demo:revisions -- --dry-run            # print the plan, write nothing
npm run demo:revisions                         # generate for every project that has none (Proposal skipped)
npm run demo:revisions -- --project DEMO-S4    # one project
npm run demo:revisions -- --include-proposal
npm run demo:revisions -- --remove             # deletes ONLY is_demo revisions (then is_demo designs left empty)
npm run demo:seed-roles                        # now also runs demo-revisions.ts at the end
```
`npm run demo:revisions` used to run the `revisions`-module seeder (`demo-seed-revisions.ts`); that file still runs inside `demo:seed-roles`, only the npm alias moved.

### Frontend
`features/designs/`: `types/design-revision.types.ts` (+`ProjectRevision`, `ProjectRevisionSummary`), `repositories/design-revision.repository.ts` (apiClient, unwraps `.data`/`.meta`, normalises status text and dates), `hooks/useProjectRevisions.ts` (stale-response guard), `components/ProjectRevisionsPanel.tsx`, mounted in `ProjectDetailPage` right after the Design stage / linked-designs block. Summary strip, design + status filters, per-design timeline (`parent → version`, `Rev N`, status badge, reason, expandable summary, author, relative time with the absolute date in `title`, approval date), a "Demo data" badge, three distinct empty states (Proposal phase / no designs / designs but no revisions), an admin-only "Generate demo revisions" button behind the existing confirm dialog (hidden when `meta.demoAllowed` is false), and inline errors that never blank the page. `RevisionsTable` now links the project code.

### Evidence
Counts: `design_revisions` 0 → 41 (S2 11, S3 10, S4 7, S5 3, S6 5, S7 5; S1 skipped as Proposal), all `is_demo`; `designs` 10, `is_demo` designs 0.
```
--dry-run          : "Dry run — nothing written. Would create 41 revision(s)"   before 0 / after 0
run 1              : Created 41 revision(s)                                     after 41 (41 demo)
run 2              : Created 0 revision(s)  (every project "already has revisions")  after 41
--remove           : Removed 41 demo revision(s) and 0 demo design(s)           after 0, designs still 10
regenerate         : Created 41
dates check        : 0 rows with created_at/approved_at in the future or approved before created
```
`npx tsx src/scripts/demo-verify-design-revisions.ts` (live API): **33 of 33 checks PASS** —
- `?projectCode=DEMO-S4` count 7 = SQL join count 7; items carry design code/name/project;
- PM who does not own S4 (`projectmanager1`) 403, engineer not staffed (`engineer1`) 403, site not staffed on S2 403; owning PM, admin, staffed consultant, staffed engineer 200;
- unfiltered lists: `architect@` only S2,S3,S4; `architect1@` only S5,S6,S7; `pm@` only S2–S5; admin S2–S7; `architect@` GET by id of an S5 revision 403;
- **no write on read:** row counts and md5 of both tables identical before/after every GET (all roles, all seven projects, plus `/designs`);
- create: 201, author from the session (`Ana Villanueva`, not the body's name), `revisionNumber` 3→4, `parentVersion` = previous version, `approvedAt` set, `designs.version/revision` = `v9.0/4`, duplicate version 409, one audit row; write on Archived S7 → `409 Project is Archived — changes are locked`; engineer / PM / HR writes 403 (the probe row was deleted and the design restored);
- `POST /design-revisions/demo`: architect 403, PM 403, admin 200 `created=0 (already has revisions)`, Proposal project skipped; production guard unit-tested (`isDemoAllowed("production", undefined)` false, with `"true"` true).
UI (headless Chrome against the dev client, signed in as the real accounts): S2 shows the panel with 11 revisions, "Latest v2.1 / Awaiting approval 3 / Last change 17 days ago", timeline grouped by design with Demo-data badges; S4 7, S7 5 (dated inside its life, before its completion); **S1 as the staffed architect: "Revisions start once a design exists. This project is still in the Proposal phase."**; S3 with its demo rows removed shows "No revisions recorded — This project has designs, but none of them has a revision history yet." plus the button, the confirm dialog text, and after confirming the panel shows the 10 generated revisions. No console errors.
Checks: `npx tsc --noEmit -p server` clean, client `npm run build` clean, `npm test` 230 pass / 0 fail (7 new). Account tables unchanged: users `48ac4a39…`, password_reset_tokens `c7b81d12…`, roles `9862b995…` — identical to the values recorded before the clean-slate wipe.

### Decisions needed
1. **Who else may write revisions?** Only Architect and Admin now. The Engineer assigned to a design could reasonably propose a revision; not added.
2. **Proposal-phase projects** get no demo revisions by default (no design can exist yet). Use `--include-proposal` if the demo should show one.
3. **Should any role see revisions of projects it is not staffed on?** Currently none (Owner, Admin and IT Designer are unrestricted, as for the project list).
4. **Two revision histories.** The newer `revisions` module (files, review workflow, the "Revisions" card and Architect page) and this `design_revisions` log both describe design changes; the project page now shows both under different titles. Decide whether `design_revisions` should be retired or fed from the newer module.

### Permission changes (may touch the Chapter 1 manuscript)
Reading design revisions is now limited to the caller's visible projects (PM: own projects; Engineer/Architect/Consultant/Site: staffed projects) — previously any signed-in role could read all. Writing is limited to Architect and Admin — previously any signed-in role could create, edit or delete.

### Not done
- Hold/On-Hold lock was not exercised separately (same `assertProjectWritable` as Archived, which was).
- The `POST /design-revisions/demo` production branch is covered by a unit test of the guard, not by running the server with `NODE_ENV=production`.

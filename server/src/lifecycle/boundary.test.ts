// server/src/lifecycle/boundary.test.ts — NEW (ai-signals D10)
//
// Enforces in code, not just in review, the "decision support never blocks"
// boundary from docs/ai-signals-progress.md section 1: gates.ts and the
// gate/progress logic in service.ts must never import the signals or
// ai-validation modules. The one sanctioned exception is
// getLifecycleView's own evaluateSignals call (Group E), which only
// APPENDS a `signals` field to the response — it can't affect canAdvance,
// gate checks, or progress, which are all computed before it runs.

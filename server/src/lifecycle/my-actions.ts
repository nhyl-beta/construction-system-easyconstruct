// server/src/lifecycle/my-actions.ts — NEW
//
// K1: "what's waiting on me, across every project" — the lifecycle gate
// checks (gates.ts) and getLifecycleView are deliberately single-project
// (they take one LifecycleSnapshot at a time); this is the cross-project
// rollup for one actor, mirroring gate checks' own ownerRoles against
// whichever projects that actor is actually relevant to, plus every
// workflow stage pending on them (workflows/repository.ts already answers
// that cross-project on its own).
//
// Lives in its own file rather than lifecycle/service.ts to avoid a circular
// import: workflows/service.ts already imports lifecycle/service.ts
// (assertProjectWritable/refreshProjectProgress), so this instead reads
// workflows/repository.ts directly — a leaf module neither side imports.

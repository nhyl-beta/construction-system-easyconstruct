 *
 * A role that can actually be staffed on a project (engineer, architect,
 * site-personnel, consultant) resolves to the real staffed user(s) via
 * project-members — a broadcast to every holder of that role org-wide would
 * reach people with nothing to do with this project. "project-manager" is
 * its own case: the project's own pmUserId, not a project-members row.
 * Every other role (admin, it-designer, finance-manager, human-resources,
 * owner) has no per-project staffing concept, so it's a role broadcast.
 * A staffable role with nobody currently staffed is silently skipped rather
 * than falling back to a role broadcast — there is no one to reach.

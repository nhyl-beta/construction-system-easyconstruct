/**
 * Philippine statutory payroll deductions.
 *
 * Replaces the flat 12% placeholder that stood in for "SSS/PhilHealth/
 * Pag-IBIG/withholding tax" as a single number. Those are four separate
 * computations on three different bases, and a payslip has to show each one,
 * so each is computed and stored separately here and `deductions` becomes
 * their sum.
 *
 * Bases and rates below are the schedules in force for 2025 onward:
 *
 *  - SSS (RA 11199, 2025 schedule): 15% of the monthly salary credit, split
 *    10% employer / 5% employee. The MSC is banded in ₱500 steps between a
 *    ₱5,000 floor and a ₱35,000 ceiling. Only the employee share is withheld
 *    from pay, so only that is deducted here.
 *  - PhilHealth (UHC Act RA 11223, 5% premium): 5% of monthly basic salary
 *    split equally employer/employee (2.5% each), on a ₱10,000–₱100,000
 *    income floor/ceiling.
 *  - Pag-IBIG (HDMF Circular 460): 1% employee share up to ₱1,500 monthly
 *    compensation, 2% above it, on a ₱10,000 maximum fund salary — so the
 *    employee share caps at ₱200.
 *  - Withholding tax (TRAIN Act RA 10963, revised 2023-onward brackets):
 *    applied to taxable income, i.e. gross minus the three contributions
 *    above, which are non-taxable by law.
 *
 * Everything is computed on a MONTHLY basis because that is what every one of
 * these schedules is defined on. A payroll run covering a shorter period is
 * annualized to a monthly equivalent, the monthly deduction is computed, then
 * prorated back — see `computeStatutoryDeductions`.
 *
 * This is a documented, deterministic implementation of the published
 * schedules, not a certified payroll engine: it does not model 13th-month
 * pay, de minimis benefits, substituted filing or the year-end annualization
 * adjustment, and the rates are versioned by hand rather than fetched.

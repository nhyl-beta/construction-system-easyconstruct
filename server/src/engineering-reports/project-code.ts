// reads reports (the PM's Reports list, gate X1, project scoping) matches that
// code exactly. A report filed under a code that matches no project is invisible
// to all of them, so the code is resolved to the stored one when a report is
// created.

 * otherwise a single case-insensitive match is accepted (so "ZH-01" finds
 * "Zh-01"); anything else is null.

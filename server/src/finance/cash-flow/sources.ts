// The single definition of "cash out". Everything that shows money leaving —
// the cash flow chart, "Monthly expenses", project profitability — reads these
// queries so the figures cannot drift apart:
//   * an APPROVED expense, in the month it was submitted (there is no
//     approved-on column on `expenses`);
//   * an APPROVED payroll batch (employer cost, gross for legacy batches), in
//     the month of the approving decision.
// Pending and rejected expenses, and budget changes, are not cash.
